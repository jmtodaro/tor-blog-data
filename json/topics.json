It seems like this wave started with a <a href=\"http://mcpmag.com/columns/article.asp?editorialsid=2470\" rel=\"nofollow\">column</a> by Russ Cooper, which triggered articles in <a href=\"http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,142094-pg,1/article.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">PC World</a> and <a href=\"http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=144606&amp;WT.svl=news2_3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dark Reading</a>. The media attention came as a bit of a surprise to me, since nobody asked to interview me over this. I'd encourage other journalists writing about Tor to contact someone from the project as we're happy to help give some context.</p>\n<p>My thesis is a fairly diverse collection of work, but the articles emphasize the impact of the attacks I discuss on users of anonymity networks like Tor. Actually, my thesis doesn't aim to show that Tor is insecure; the reason I selected Tor as a test case was that it's one of the few (and by far the largest) low-latency system that aims to stand up to observation.  Other, simpler, systems have comparatively well understood weaknesses, and so there is less value in researching them.</p>\n<p>Quantifying the security of anonymity systems is a difficult question and still being actively worked on. Comparing different systems is even harder since they make different assumptions on the capabilities of attackers (the &#8220;threat model&#8221;). The mere chance of attacks doesn't indicate that a system is insecure, since they might make assumptions about the environment that are not met, or are insufficiently reliable for the scenario being considered.</p>\n<p>The actual goal of my thesis was try to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of systems like Tor, but more importantly to also to suggest a more general methodology for discovering, and resolving flaws. I proposed that the work from the well-established field of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_channel\" rel=\"nofollow\">covert channels</a> could be usefully applied, and used examples, including Tor, to justify this.</p>\n<p>There remains much work to be done before it's possible to be sure how secure anonymity systems are, but hopefully this framework will be a useful one in moving forward. Since in September 2007 I joined the Tor project, I hope I'll also help in other ways too.</p>"

There were times when the state needed to know the author or printer of a work in order to know who to prosecute for heresy or sedition. In 1579, John Stubbs had his right hand cut off for writing a work opposing the marriage of Elizabeth I to a French nobleman. Elizabeth herself urged that the printers of the anti-Anglican Marprelate tracts should be subjected to torture. In 1663, a London printer who published a pamphlet which argued that the monarch should be accountable to his subjects, and justified the people’s right to rebellion, was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered. He refused, even so, to reveal the name of the pamphlet’s author, though the disclosure might have saved his life. Between the 16th and the 18th century, printers were fined, imprisoned and pilloried for publishing supposedly treasonable works whose authors remained concealed. Being Jonathan Swift’s printer was not a job for the faint-hearted.</p>\n<p>Looking for modern parallels, can you imagine the head of an ISP risking execution to defend the anonymity of a person publishing something via their servers when a government or company takes exception to it? <span class='read-more'><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/anonymous-publishing-and-risking-execution\"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p>"

Upon the start of the Tor client, a large file with all Tor server descriptions is being downloaded. An evolution of the Tor protocol is aimed to reduce the initial download size. The new Tor protocol version shall change the way a client receives the information for its Tor circuit setup in a way, that the initial download can be performed over a slow modem line in less then three minutes.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.torproject.org/projects/hidserv\" rel=\"nofollow\">Speeding up Hidden Services</a>.\n<p>The Tor anonymity system contains an important function that is called Tor Hidden Services, which allows users to set up anonymous information services, like websites, that can only be accessed through the Tor network and are protected against identification of the host that runs the services. Using these function, critical political and human rights information can be published in a way that protects the publisher and users of the service from repression and identification. The most critical limitation of this function is the time it takes until a Hidden Service is registered in the network and the latency of contact establishment when accessed by a user. The aim of this project is to develop the new protocol which will change the way Tor circuits are set up between the user and the Hidden Service as well as the way a Hidden Service is registered in the Tor network.</li>\n</ul>"

However, with the 1.2.0rc5 release of Torbutton, I'm pleased to report that the majority of those now seem to be <a href=\"https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/CHANGELOG\" rel=\"nofollow\">behind us</a> (a few annoying <a href=\"https://torbutton.torproject.org/dev/design/#FirefoxBugs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firefox bugs</a> notwithstanding).</p>\n<p>Thanks to contributions from <a href=\"http://www.fdn.fr/~arenevier/\" rel=\"nofollow\">arno</a>, the Cookie Jar features now work with Firefox 3.

The workaround is to manually set the environment variable 'TZ' to 'UTC' before starting Firefox.

Welcome to dead hard drives.</p>\n<p>For a long while, I used <a href=\"http://www.vmware.com/products/server/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VMware Server</a> for guest OSes to build the various rpm and windows packages.  This mostly worked well.  And then both drives in the physical server I used to host the vmware instance failed.  A two-drive RAID 1 array doesn't like it when both drives fail.  I replaced the drives, re-installed Debian, and attempted to install vmware server again.  The vmware kernel module refused to load.  I tried the old tricks to get it to work, nothing.  I finally looked at some script/patch that I found via Google, and got the module to load.  Then my license key didn't work anymore.  </p>\n<p>In frustration, I gave up and installed <a href=\"http://www.virtualbox.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">VirtualBox</a>.  CentOS 4 defaults to using an SMP kernel on install, which Virtualbox (aka qemu) doesn't like at all.  CentOS 4 installs just fine, it just won't boot after install.  I haven't had time to further fix the problem.  For the time being, there's no CentOS 4 (Redhat 4 rpms) for Tor.  </p>\n<p>As for OSX, well, there was no raid array of any kind, just a single drive in a mac mini.  It died in a fit of 0xE0030005 (Undefined) errors and now won't boot at all.  A new drive is on the way.  I expect to have OSX Tiger/10.4 packages in a week or so.  The good news is that the <a href=\"http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/stats/imac_se_dv_400.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Panther Mac</a> continues to work just fine.  </p>\n<p>Perhaps it's time to start using Amazon's EC2 or something similar instead of messing with all this hardware and virtualization software.  Or maybe I should work on hacking OSX 10.4 and 10.5 into virtualbox.</p>\n<p>** Update 2008-08-06:  new drive was DOA.  And it appears the logic board on the mac mini is fried.  Ugh.</p>"

The topic of online anonymity periodically rises to the social consciousness in South Korea.  This time, it's about the suicide of a well-known actress, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi_Jin-sil\" rel=\"nofollow\">Choi Jin-sil</a>.  It's sad that she chose to commit suicide, and I'm sorry she felt she had no where to go for help.  However, blaming the Internet for her death is dubious at best.  The Internet is a collection of networks.  The Internet is a thing, not a person.  While I dislike rude telemarketers, I don't blame the telephone company for providing the connection.  In this case, there seemed to be a subset of people bent on defaming her regardless of the circumstances, while using the Internet as their communication medium.  </p>\n<p>The real goal behind this upswelling of support for banning anonymity is to pass the Cyber Defamation Law.  This appears to be the equivalent of user verification where all online activities must be in a real name and, in some way, verifiable.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"We will press hard to pass the Cyber Defamation Law and the real-name system,\" Hong Joon-pyo, the ruling Grand National Party's floor leader, told reporters last week. \"It is wrong to neglect the fact that violence is rampant online, due to anonymity.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p>Defamation is already a crime in South Korea.  The irony is that the person who possibly first defamed Choi Jin-sil has been found, a person only known by their last name, Paik.  According to the article,<br />\n<blockquote>\"Paik was questioned by investigators soon after Choi's suicide and ultimately indicted for defamation.\" <span class='read-more'><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/online-anonymity-debate-south-korea\"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p></blockquote>"

In reality, I think these people are looking for Tor's opinion on this sort of \"news\".  Rather than pick apart the silliness of the statements, a few things bothered me about the TechRadar article; which I've already heard many times.</p>\n<p>Let's tackle the misnomer that the Internet is inherently anonymous.  This quote states the \"common wisdom\":</p>\n<blockquote><p>It's true that the TCP/IP protocol, as currently implemented, makes it very hard to verify the source of any given network packet, but that's purely because the network architects chose to make it that way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In fact, IP addresses are designed and used for routing.  It's easy to figure out where traffic originates if you have the IP address.  What's not so easy is figuring out if the owner of the system at that IP address was the actual sender of the traffic.  There's a popular notion that you are your IP address; and that actions taken with your IP can be tied back to you.  IP addresses are for routing, not authentication.  The Air Force plan wants to solve the latter problem of authentication (Network friend or foe).  A subpoena or legal demand of a provider (blog, forum, ISP, etc) can reveal the IP address and possibly its owner.</p>\n<p>The larger concern with the article is that it states:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But it's also what lets protesters protest and dissidents diss, so there are some genuinely valid reasons for wanting to preserve internet privacy</p></blockquote>\n<p>and then ends with <span class='read-more'><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/anonymity-internet-not-going-away.\"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p>"

The dual Xeon kept up with the demands fairly well.  I ran it with the default exit policy with open irc ports.  Things went smoothly for many months until my ISP called.  The Abuse Department said my IP was reported in a mass irc bot attack against <a href=\"http://www.dal.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DalNet</a>.  I spent some time on the phone  explaining Tor, explaining how it's an anonymizing proxy, and how it's used for good in the world.  I highlighted that of the megabits of bandwidth it provided 7x24 for many months, this was the first issue.  They asked that I block irc ports, and all would be well.  I modified the exit policy to block irc ports.  </p>\n<p>Many more months passed without issue.  Apparently, given the lax bandwidth controls, many other customers ran Tor exit nodes as well.  The ISP updated their Terms of Service, and notified all of us that running any proxy was now in violation of the ToS.  This meant I was at risk of disconnection.  I switched to a non-exit configuration.  I ran this way for months. I knew full well I was violating the ToS.  If I was disconnected, it was my fault. Then the ISP was bought; and the new owners demanded I shut off my Tor node or be disconnected.  It was fun while it lasted.</p>\n<p>Welcome to 2005.  New ISP, same nickname, different server, same non-exit Tor configuration.  Tor loved the dual opteron cpus.  The difference in cpu load was dramatic.  The load before was 40-50% cpu for \"NumCPU 2\" on the dual Xeons.  On the dual Opterons, the load was 5-10%.  Same non-exit config.  Same version of Tor.  Different hardware, newer version of the OS (Redhat 4 as opposed to CentOS 3). <span class='read-more'><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/five-years-exit-node-operator\"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p>"

It turns out for years we've been<br />\nshipping a Info.plist with an incorrect key.  The issue was discovered<br />\nand reported as bug 876,<br />\n<a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/flyspray/index.php?id=876&amp;do=details\" title=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/flyspray/index.php?id=876&amp;do=details\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bugs.torproject.org/flyspray/index.php?id=876&amp;do=details</a>.   </p>\n<p>The commit to fix the problem in the 0_2_0 branch is r17472:<br />\n<a href=\"http://archives.seul.org/or/cvs/Dec-2008/msg00037.html\" title=\"http://archives.seul.org/or/cvs/Dec-2008/msg00037.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://archives.seul.org/or/cvs/Dec-2008/msg00037.html</a></p>\n<p>The commit to fix the problem in the Vidalia 0.1 branch is r3361:<br />\n<a href=\"http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/branches/vidalia-0.1/pkg/osx?order=date&amp;desc=1\" title=\"http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/branches/vidalia-0.1/pkg/osx?order=date&amp;desc=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://trac.vidalia-project.net/browser/vidalia/branches/vidalia-0.1/pkg...</a></p>\n<p>The bug is that the OS X Installer will prompt \"The chosen volume<br />\ncontains software which is newer then [sic] the software you are<br />\ninstalling.\"</p>\n<p>The problem is that the Installer looks in the file<br />\n/Library/Receipts/Vidalia.pkg/Contents/Info.plist for<br />\nCFBundleShortVersionString.  We mistakenly called it<br />\nCFBundleSortVersionString, which Apple inserts \"1\" as the value.  The<br />\nupgrade to Vidalia from 0.1.9 to 0.1.10 apparently triggered the issue.  </p>\n<p>The fix is to put the correct value in place for the future.  The<br />\nsimplest way to do this is to have the users click \"Continue\" when<br />\nprompted.  We could have spent a lot of time trying to fix it for the<br />\nuser to hide the issue, but well, that is fraught with problems and<br />\ncomplexities.  A simple click of \"Continue\" is far simpler and less<br />\nerror prone.   </p>\n<p>The difference between the released 0.2.0.32 Tor code is the inclusion<br />\nof r17472.  It's not really 0.2.0.32a per se, but since we lack package<br />\nversions, I had to distinguish it in some way. </p></blockquote>"

They're a big serious company, with a serious \"enterprise\" pricing structure.  But, fortunately to us, they have <a href=\"http://scan.coverity.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">a program</a> to provide the use of these tools, free of charge, to selected open source projects.  They've been scanning development snapshots of Tor for bugs since last September.</p>\n<p>In September, they found 171 issues in our code.  Many of these were just sloppiness in our unit tests' error handing, but a good fraction were real bugs in our main codebase, a couple of which could have resulted in crashes under unusual circumstances that probably would have been hard to debug.  By December, we were down to 15 issues.

    "content": "<p>We've always argued that safe circumvention requires anonymity, even from the circumvention service itself.  There are many people wanting to record your Internet traffic and browsing patterns; from governments to commercial advertising networks.  There are many ways to defeat the threat of traffic analysis; from simple proxy providers, virtual private networks, and distributed peer to peer solutions.   Only some of these offer anonymity along with circumvention. Tor's open design and anonymity properties provide protections for the user from those watching the traffic and from us as an organization.</p>\n<p>Our architecture and design don't force the user to assume trust in us.  Our code is <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/\" rel=\"nofollow\">accessible</a> and <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/LICENSE\" rel=\"nofollow\">licensed under an open license</a>.  Our <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git\" rel=\"nofollow\">specifications</a> are clearly detailed and published. Our <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download\" rel=\"nofollow\">packages</a> follow a defined build process so the user can create the same binaries we do. Independent researchers can and do test the properties Tor provides [and help us to improve].  Moreover, The Tor software runs on a distributed network, where a single operator cannot capture or be forced to capture all users' traffic information, even under legal or coercive threat.</p>\n<p>All of these should allow the user to trust The Tor Project as a <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople\" rel=\"nofollow\">not-for-profit company</a> and to trust that Tor isn't surreptitiously watching the very information you're trying to protect and isn't gathering information we could be forced to disclose.</p>\n<p>We're always willing to work with other organizations who understand that anonymity provides stronger circumvention protections than the alternatives.</p>"

I recently wrote up a status report for the progress we're making on hacking Libevent, and I thought I'd post it here too.</p>\n<p>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>Tor currently uses Libevent for its high-performance networking calls.  Libevent is a software library originally written by Niels Provos (then of UMichigan, now of Google), and now co-developed by Niels Provos and the Tor Project's Nick Mathewson.  Its purpose is to provide consistent fast interfaces to various operating systems' mutually incompatible fast networking facilities.  Libevent gives applications two basic interfaces to these networking layers: a low-level interface where the application is notified when an operation (like a network read or write) is ready to begin, and a higher-level interface where Libevent itself manages network operations and the application is notified when the network operations are completed. <span class='read-more'><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/some-notes-progress-iocp-and-libevent\"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p>"

These data are there anyway as they are required for clients to make good path selection decisions and build circuits.

    "content": "<p>Thanks to a friend who's a professor at <a href=\"http://www.kaist.edu/edu.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">KAIST</a> in Korea, several teams of students there are working for their \"freshman design class\" on designing new bridge (aka bridge relay) distribution strategies. Here's some early brainstorming on what the actual problems are and what needs doing.</p>\n<p>Background: Tor uses directory servers to give out information about what relays are in the network. But blocking connections between users and the main Tor network is actually not that hard &mdash; after all, there's a public list of relays, which needs to stay public so clients can know where to connect.  That's where <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridge relays</a> come in. Now that we've deployed bridge relays, we changed the arms race from \"how do we prevent the adversary from learning about 2000 IP address that we're openly publishing?\" (which is an impossible problem) to \"how do we take these several thousand secret IP addresses and give them out one at a time to the good guys, without letting the bad guys learn all of them?\" Hopefully that's a more manageable arms race. You can read more background in the <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/blocking.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">blocking-resistance design doc</a> and <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/~arma/23C3-1444-en-tor_and_china.m4v\" rel=\"nofollow\">video</a>.</p>\n<p>Here's the problem in a nutshell: what are some creative ways to distribute the IP addresses for bridge relays, such that ordinary users can generally learn a few bridge addresses, but an attacker can't learn all of them?</p>\n<p>The key point is that we need diversity of distribution strategies. It's hard to predict the interests and capabilities of the adversary, so it will be hard to predict which strategies are going to be successful.</p>\n<p>How do bridges work behind the scenes? Bridge relays anonymously upload their <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#KeyManagement\" rel=\"nofollow\">server descriptors</a> to the bridge authority, which aggregates the list and checks which bridges are reachable and working.  We've written a set of tools called <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git/tree\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridgedb</a> that looks at this list and gives out addresses to users according to various strategies. Each bridge address is only available via one of the strategies, so if one strategy turns out to be weak, the attacker only gets to learn the bridges associated with that strategy.</p>\n<p>So far we've deployed three simple strategies: IP-based, email autoresponder, and manual. For the IP-based strategy, we look at which IP address you're coming from and list a few bridges, but we always answer a given IP address with the same list. That way an attacker needs to have a wide variety of IP addresses before he can learn many of the bridges allocated to this strategy. For the email autoresponder, we answer a given email address with a few bridges, but we answer the same way if that email address asks again. And for the manual strategy, we keep some bridge addresses in reserve, a) in case the other two strategies get broken at the same time, and b) to be able to give them out to people who ask on IRC, IM, etc.</p>\n<p>Of course, it gets much more complex when we consider all the practical issues that come up. For example, for the IP-based strategy, we need to count nearby addresses (e.g. the whole <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netmask\" rel=\"nofollow\">/24 netblock</a>) as the same address, or an attacker with a single class C could be lots of different addresses. We also need to treat open proxies &mdash; and Tor exit relays! &mdash; separately, or it's too easy to search for <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=open+proxies\" rel=\"nofollow\">open proxies</a> and beat it. Tor provides an easy-to-use <a href=\"https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py\" rel=\"nofollow\">list of exit addresses</a>, but how do we easily collect an up-to-date list of open proxy addresses?</p>\n<p>And for the email autoresponder, how do we prevent an attacker who controls a given domain from just creating thousands of email addresses at that domain, and learning lots of bridges? Our current answer is to only answer requests from a few domains &mdash; in particular, Gmail &mdash; that we know have reasonable ways to slow down creation of lots of accounts. In this way we leverage Gmail's \"is a human\" checks without having to design our own. Gmail also provides another feature: it signs all its outgoing mail using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail\" rel=\"nofollow\">dkim</a>.  If it didn't, an attacker could forge mail from a variety of Gmail addresses and make it look like we're spamming them. After a while, Gmail would mark us as a spam source, and suddenly none of our mails would get through anymore.</p>\n<p>How do we handle churn? After all, if we are truly answering the same address with the same set of bridges, then if those bridges go away, we'll be giving out useless addresses. Our current answer is based on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing\" rel=\"nofollow\">consistent hashing</a>. We hash each bridge's identity key, and then when a request comes in, we hash that request's address. Whichever hash(bridge key) is nearest to that hash(address) is the one we give out, along with the two bridges after that for robustness. Now we're always giving out bridges from the same location in the hash table, even if one of those bridges disappears for a while (or a new one shows up).</p>\n<p>We could imagine a lot more strategies. For example, the user SMS's us from a given phone number, and we send a few bridge addresses back. Or we wrap the bridge addresses using <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=time-release+crypto\" rel=\"nofollow\">time-release crypto</a>, such that it takes the user (or the attacker) a few hours of CPU-time to decrypt it. Or we get all the users to subscribe to a mailing list, and we send out a new bridge address every 6 hours, in hopes that the users can use them a while before the attacker gets around to blocking them.  Or heck, another strategy would be just collecting $10 from the user for each request for bridge addresses.</p>\n<p>Another option is a social networking approach: rather than relying on technical tricks, rely on trust between humans to limit the risk that bridge addresses will fall into the wrong hands, and maybe construct a reputation system to identify participants whose bridge addresses get blocked more often than they \"should\". This idea gets messy quickly: see <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/blocking.html#tth_sEc7.4\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"strategy six\"</a> in the blocking-resistance design doc for more thoughts.</p>\n<p>There are four components to tackling this general design question.</p>\n<p>1) Identify some resources such that it's straightforward to get a few of them, but harder to get many of them. The ones I listed above are just a few examples, and I'm sure there are dozens more out there.</p>\n<p>2) Speculate about the capabilities of various attackers (ISPs, countries, intelligence agencies, companies, etc), and analyze how hard it would actually be for them to collect lots of the resource. The ideal resource here would be something that's asymmetric, such that the right individuals can get it cheaply but the wrong parties will find it expensive. For example, the strategies based on IP address, email account, or even phone number are brittle: they would not stand up well to an attacker who has access to lots of different IP networks, can solve thousands of captchas, or owns a phone company. The social network based approach is an example of a resource that's more asymmetric: infiltrating a human-based network takes more resources than solving a bunch of captchas. Figure out which attackers your strategy is robust against, and which attackers it isn't.</p>\n<p>3) Figure out how you'd actually build it in practice, and how you could make it more robust against attack. Where do we get a list of open proxies for the IP address strategy, and how effective would that actually be at slowing down various attackers? How do you receive SMS's on the Internet, and how do you send them in a sustainable (e.g. free) way? What is the true cost of getting a new phone number? (Gmail sometimes demands a new phone number for creating an account &mdash; this approach created an unexpected secondary market, where spammers would buy a new SIM card, use it just for its phone number, then resell it for almost full price since all the minutes were intact.) How hard is it in practice (measured in time, cash, skills, etc) to get 500 Gmail accounts? How do you pick the \"seeds\" of your social network, and are there unexpected security problems that come up, e.g. keeping sensitive information about users on a central site that the adversary could attack? These questions are only a few examples, and you'll have to extrapolate from them to figure out good questions to ask for your own designs.</p>\n<p>4) The best way to figure out if you've thought about all the issues is to actually try to build it. You could build it as a module in the bridgedb tools, or as a separate standalone program. Try to have your friends (or other design teams) attack it, and see if they come up with new approaches or vulnerabilities that you hadn't considered.</p>\n<p>While you're at it, there are a variety of other design questions that come up around bridges, and understanding them may help you come up with good approaches.</p>\n<p>1) We only have about 500 bridge addresses right now total. Does your distribution strategy work well when it's trying to protect only a few hundred bridge addresses, or does it only start to be effective when there are tens of thousands?</p>\n<p>2) Some of these strategies, like the SMS approach, might be able to be monitored by the attacker. Thus a) he can passively enumerate bridge addresses just by monitoring his own users, and b) he can passively enumerate people who ask for bridge addresses. First of all that vulnerability makes the strategy less robust (it's easier than we thought for that class of attacker to gather addresses). But second, it may put the users at higher risk. Strategies like the Gmail auto-responder might be safer, since the users have SSL link encryption when sending and receiving mail. That is, assuming they trust Google.</p>\n<p>3) It's a shame that we need to use a centralized bridge authority here.  That means an attacker who can break into the bridge authority can learn all of the bridge addresses at once. Further, the bridge authority needs to learn which bridges are reachable (to know which ones to give out), which provides another avenue for an attacker. Are there ways to distribute bridge addresses over more than one bridge authority, in a way that can handle churn and still preserves our rate-limited release properties?</p>\n<p>4) How do we test whether bridges are reachable from inside some of these countries? The bridge authority can either test directly (which has problems), or test via Tor (which has different problems). See sections <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/blocking.html#tth_sEc7.6\" rel=\"nofollow\">7.6</a> and <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/blocking.html#subsec:geoip\" rel=\"nofollow\">7.7</a> of the blocking-resistance document for more discussion.</p>\n<p>Overall, a lot of the challenge here comes from not having a good handle on how powerful the attackers might be. In the cryptography world, the standard approach is to assume an extremely powerful attacker, and design a system that can protect against even that. But here, it would seem that convenience and usability are at odds with this traditional approach to strong security &mdash; not to mention that we don't even know how to provide strong (crypto-grade) security in this context.</p>\n<p>Last, it's worth noting that so far no countries have blocked the public Tor network. Tor played a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/measuring-tor-and-iran-part-two\" rel=\"nofollow\">big role in Iran's organizations and demonstrations in June</a>, and it has even more users in China, Russia, and other repressive countries. So the arms race has already begun, and none of the adversaries have proved to be powerful enough and/or concerned enough to take a step. Building a broad range of strategies &mdash; from convenient but breakable ones to very secure ones &mdash; will be the best preparation for however the arms race plays out.</p>"

    "content": "<p>This summer I have been working on new feature for the Torbutton Firefox extension with Mike Perry as my mentor. The Tor Project volunteer page describes this project as requiring a high skill and effort level. Initially, I was confident in the effort that I was capable of putting forth, however I was doubtful of my skill level. My knowledge of XUL (an xml based markup language for the Mozilla Framework) and Javascript  was a medium at best.  Knowing that I was going to have to spend a good amount of time becoming adept with these languages, I took on writing three new features for Torbutton.  </p>\n<p>The first feature is handling tor:// and tors:// urls. I implemented these protocols to be handled by Torbutton, and will be opened in your Tor connection.  If you do not have Tor enabled, you will be prompted to enable it. In addition, I added options in any link’s context menu for copying Tor URLs and opening them in a new window or tab. <span class='read-more'><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/summer-torbutton\"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p>"

I'll give an overview of the Tor architecture, and summarize the variety of people who use it and what security it provides. Then we'll focus on the use of tools like Tor in countries like Iran and China: why anonymity is important for circumvention, why transparency in design and operation is critical for trust, the role of popular media in helping – and harming – the effectiveness of the tools, and tradeoffs between usability and security. After describing Tor's strategy for secure circumvention (what we thought would work), I'll talk about how the arms race actually seems to be going in practice.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The slides of the presentation can be found at the bottom of this post.  </p>\n<p>We've mirrored the full 700MB video of the presentation at <a href=\"http://media.torproject.org/video/26c3-3554-de-tor_and_censorship_lessons_learned.mp4\" title=\"http://media.torproject.org/video/26c3-3554-de-tor_and_censorship_lessons_learned.mp4\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://media.torproject.org/video/26c3-3554-de-tor_and_censorship_lesson...</a></p>"

Another reason for the issues is that we're caught in a tricky balance between making the CAPTCHA easy to pass for humans with legitimate comments versus automated comment spammers.  And then there are the human comment spammers which can pass any CAPTCHA we put up with varying degrees of success.  We're up to hundreds of spam comments per day.  We don't want to use a third party CAPTCHA or comment service because then we're giving up all our viewers to their tracking mechanisms.  There's already enough surveillance on the Internet.  Therefore, comments are disabled for the next day while we assess the load on the blog.  </p>\n<p>We are working on forums, right now they are tied up in making sure they are functional without javascript.

Relays<br />\n      now close idle circuits early if it looks like they were intended<br />\n      for directory fetches. Relays are also more aggressive about closing<br />\n      TLS connections that have no circuits on them. Such circuits are<br />\n      unlikely to be re-used, and tens of thousands of them were piling<br />\n      up at the fast relays, causing the relays to run out of sockets<br />\n      and memory. Bugfix on 0.2.0.22-rc (where clients started tunneling<br />\n      their directory fetches over TLS).</p>\n<p>  o Minor features: <span class='read-more'><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/april-2010-progress-report\"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p>"

Moreover, I've only received about 4 abuse complaints in as many years of running exit nodes. This is in stark contrast to other node operators following a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/five-years-exit-node-operator\">more reactive strategy</a>. I'm convinced this is largely because I observe the following pro-active guidelines. This guide is primarily US centric.

This allows us to have a more dynamic website and a better interface to derive our statistics and visuals from.

    "content": "<p>Here's a quick update on what we're seeing from Tor clients in Iran.  This is an update to <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-blocking-activity-iran\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-blocking-activity-iran\">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-blocking-activity-iran</a>.  It appears that one of the five Iranian ISPs is experimenting in blocking censorship circumvention tools; such as Tor, Freegate, Ultrasurf, and Hot Spot Shield.  There have been reports that this update to censorship technologies was coming soon, <a href=\"https://www.azadcyber.info/articles/1560\" title=\"https://www.azadcyber.info/articles/1560\">https://www.azadcyber.info/articles/1560</a>.</p>\n<p>Previously, we had data suggesting that ssl-connections were being throttled or experiencing a forced reduced-throughput.  It seems this is no longer the case.  A simple IP address access list is used to stop access to the public Tor nodes, as well as many Tor bridges.   An example of this blocklist on the Iranian Tor users:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/direct-users-2011-01-21-ir-2010-10-23.png\"></p>\n<p>and</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/bridge-users-2011-01-21-ir-2010-10-23.png\"></p>\n<p>We are seeing success in users choosing to configure their Tor clients to use a <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/proxychain\">socks or https proxy</a> and then connecting to the public Tor network.  The trick here is that Iranian tor users now look to be coming from wherever the open proxy is located.  A few volunteers in Europe and SE Asia have setup <a href=\"http://www.inet.no/dante/\">proxy servers</a> restricted to Iranian IP space.</p>\n<p>On a more technical level, here's what we were seeing last week for ssl manipulation, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/https-traffic-flow.txt\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/https-traffic-flow.txt\">https://blog.torproject.org/files/https-traffic-flow.txt</a>.  What's interesting is the tor-server to client communication is with a TTL of 40.  The TLSv1 Encrypted Alert is from the tor-server, except the TTL is 39.  Unless the tor-server suddenly jumped one hop further from the client, something intercepted the connection and injected that packet on behalf of the tor-server.   </p>\n<p>This week we're seeing straight IP blocking after the ssl handshake starts, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/ip-blocking.txt\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/ip-blocking.txt\">https://blog.torproject.org/files/ip-blocking.txt</a>.  In both cases, this is to the same tor bridge from the same tor client as before.  </p>\n<p>In a short few months, Iran has vastly improved the sophistication of their censorship technologies.  Right now, the best option is to use tor through open socks/https proxies.  A risk is the open proxies can see you are using tor, but cannot see the traffic passing through the open proxy, for everything is wrapped in layers of encryption by Tor.  However, it appears the Iranian Potato Wall can detect Tor or not in any case by analyzing the traffic on the wire.  We have reports this is true for other circumvention tools as well.</p>\n<p>I thank the many people that have taken risks to share data with us.</p>"

    "content": "<p>The current state of affairs in Egypt looks quite bleak for people using Vodafone, Orange, TE Data, and other well-known service providers. It is reported that each of those companies was ordered by the Egyptian government to turn down their internet services. The nature of the order and its legality is of course very unclear at this time. What is known is that nearly in perfect unison many Egyptian ISPs turned down their BGP route announcements to countries outside of Egypt and from what we've been able to gather they're also not peering with each other. The cables connecting (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FALCON_(cable_system)\">FLAG</a> and <a href=\"http://www.seabone.net/\">SEABONE</a>) Egypt to the world are still  <i>physically</i> intact.</p>\n<p>The impact of de-peering is significant; even if someone is able to get packets directly to the edge routers of TE Data or another ISP, no response will be forthcoming. <a href=\"http://www.renesys.com/blog/2011/01/egypt-leaves-the-internet.shtml\">Renesys</a>, <a href=\"http://stat.ripe.net/egypt/\">RIPE</a>, and <a href=\"http://bgpmon.net/blog/?p=450\">BGPmon</a> have fantastic technical details for those without access to an active BGP router.</p>\n<p>At this point it is also well-known that the ISP Noor has been up through the entire event. With access to systems inside of Egypt, we have discovered that it appears to be entirely unfiltered - Tor works perfectly, controversial websites are not blocked, and it is even quite fast compared to our systems on other Egyptian networks. As of very late last night, systems from Noor were still unable to reach systems on TE Data or other networks in Egypt. Early this morning it appears that another ISP, Etisalat (AS36992), returned to the Internet (via nileonline.palermo7.pal.seabone.net) and we're working with contacts in Egypt to test any possible filtering and to ensure that Tor is functional on their network.</p>\n<p>In our tests of the TE Data network before it disconnected, we found very heavy handed but sloppy filtering. Tests of popular websites revealed that TE Data filtered based on IP blocklists, they did not tamper with DNS queries, they did not trigger TCP resets on keywords, nor did they attempt to perform any kind of Man-In-The-Middle attacks on SSL or SSH connections. While it is possible that TE Data may have layer seven filtering or Deep Packet Inspection capabilities, it does not appear to have used any advanced filtering methods.</p>\n<p>While the seemingly unfiltered nature of Noor's network is a positive development and sharply contrasts with the heavy filtering of TE Data's network, we have no methods for discovering data retention policies or wiretapping capabilities of any of the available networks in Egypt. We urge all people in Egypt to consider that any ISP may log data and depending on political outcomes, it may not be favorable to have easy to trace records of your online activities.</p>\n<p>Many Egyptians are also using dial up services that route through the Egyptian controlled state telecommunications systems. While on the face this seems safe and it may very well be safer than a known filtered or probably wiretapped network, it's certainly not outside of the capabilities of the Egyptian authorities to decode or analyse these kinds of communications. We urge people who are using dial up systems or leased lines, VSAT or even BGAN connections to be cautious. The nature of any internet connection has a variable difficulty for monitoring but it is by no means impossible. That's why we're working so hard on Tor because the world needs software for traffic analysis resistance; the internet doesn't have this for free and certainly not in a country with a highly centralized internet architecture.</p>\n<p>There is a serious trade off to be made by users in hostile network environments with major political instability: Tor usage is possibly detectable with a skilled adversary. Connections made with questionable \"privacy\" or \"security\" proxy services are certainly easier than detecting Tor because of their static nature. The same is true of VPN services: all of these things are probably detectable with the right understanding and the proper equipment. It goes without saying that entirely unprotected connections to known unfavorable sites or services is detectable and well within the reach of the Egyptian network operators.</p>\n<p>Please understand that while we make no promises, we believe that Tor is currently the best option for people in this situation. It's what we use when we're in Egypt and it's what we think will serve people the best in Egypt when they have a network connection to the rest of the internet.</p>\n<p>The number of users in Egypt in the last week has skyrocketed:<br />\n<img src=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/eg-users2-2011-01-28.png\"></p>\n<p>The number of bridges run around the world has increased remarkably:<br />\n<img src=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/running-bridges-2011-01-28.png\"></p>\n<p>Most impressively, the number of fully public Tor relays has increased:<br />\n<img src=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/relays-diff-2011-01-28.png\"></p>\n<p>It appears that the Tor network itself has gained bandwidth capacity and geographical scope thanks to people concerned with the situation in Egypt. If you'd like to get involved, we'd love it if you could help by <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en\">running a Tor relay or a Tor bridge</a>.</p>\n<p>Update: As of late January 30th, most of Egypt's BGP routes for residential access has been pulled from the Internet.</p>"

It's up to you, the user, to choose where you share your personal information. Currently, we do not try very hard to hide that you are using Tor.  In the past few years, we haven't needed to hide. Tor looks like an SSL connection on the wire. Your local ISP, if they are very clever, could map your current connections from your assigned IP address to the list of public Tor relays. This would only tell them you are using Tor, not where you are going on the Internet. We do offer <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges.html.en\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridge relays</a>, which are semi-public relays published in a few selective ways. By using bridges, your ISP is unlikely to figure out you are using Tor. We need thousands more bridges, please <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay\" rel=\"nofollow\">join the Tor network</a> to help others.</p>\n<p>Many years ago, we theorized this arms race could happen.  Recent events have turned theory into reality. We are working on improvements to make it much more difficult to detect Tor usage. These methods include <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/176-revising-handshake.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">normalization of our TLS usage</a> and <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/spec/proposals/ideas/xxx-pluggable-transport.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">tunneling</a> Tor through other protocols, such as XMPP, HTTPS, and HTTP.</p>\n<p>Thanks to some <a href=\"https://secure.avaaz.org/en/egypt_blackout/\" rel=\"nofollow\">funding from Avaaz</a>, we've also begun experimenting with ways to make Tor perform better on satellite and mesh networks.  We have Tor working well on <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mobile phone 3G and 4G connections</a>. Tor over <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Very_small_aperture_terminal\" rel=\"nofollow\">VSAT</a> and <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Broadband_Global_Area_Network\" rel=\"nofollow\">BGAN</a> connections does work, however it needs more research into how to better handle the variable latencies and varying available bandwidth on such connections.  The improvements that result from this research will benefit those with little to no Internet access, whether due to political unrest, natural disasters, or remote locations, who nonetheless seek to keep their online activities safe.</p>"

The simplistic metric also gets misused in academic research papers to produce misleading results like \"I can sign up 2% of the Tor relays and capture 50% of the paths,\" when what they mean is \"I can provide half the capacity in the Tor network and capture half the paths.\"</p>\n<p>There are four parts to this research problem. First, we need a broad array of metrics that reflect various instances of our partial network adversary. Second, we need to understand for each metric how stable it is (sensitivity analysis) and what changes in the Tor network would efficiently improve (or harm) it. Third, we should make the calculations as realistic as possible based on actual Tor client behavior.

Tor Weather is a web application used<br />\nto allow tor relay operators to sign up for notices when their relay is offline,<br />\ndrops below a threshold of bandwidth served, and receive notifications when a<br />\nnew version of tor is released.  This version of the web application was written<br />\nby the Wesleyan University Humantarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS)<br />\nteam working on Tor for their summer project, <a href=\"http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/\" title=\"http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hfoss.wesleyan.edu/</a>. </li>\n<li>Karsten started improving metrics-db performance, so that it can scale to<br />\nfive years of data with 10K relays and 5K bridges.  This included a few tricks<br />\nto avoid parsing the same data twice.  Also changed the database schema to use<br />\nSQL arrays to store bandwidth histories, which is apparently a less used part of<br />\nPostgreSQL, because he found a confirmed bug in PostgreSQL 8.2 (released<br />\n2006-12-05).</li>\n<li>Karsten found two major, if not blocking, bugs in Torouter when run on the<br />\nsuggested Buffalo hardware.

Updated metrics-db and sanitized<br />\nall bridge descriptors since May 2008 once again.  The latter kept two of our<br />\ncomputers busy for 2.5 weeks.</li>\n<li>Karsten started with exporting bridge pool assignments and restarted<br />\ndiscussion about preserving hashed IP addresses in bridge descriptors.</li>\n<li>Karsten upgraded Torperfs to output information about which circuits they<br />\nused for measuring download times.  Made data available on metrics website.<br />\nAdded new graphs combining all Torperf sources and showing the fraction of<br />\ntimeouts and failures.  Started Torperfs with custom entry guard selection<br />\nstrategies.</li>\n<li>Karsten talked to Björn Scheuermann and Florian Tschorsch about<br />\nperformance improvements in Tor.  Working on a patch with them to be included in<br />\nTor 0.2.3.x.</li>\n<li>Karsten improved graphs on metrics-web by adding more countries and by<br />\nallowing users to customize the graph image resolution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>More reliable download mechanism.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sebastian and Erinn started to tackle Thandy and Hudson work. They solved<br />\nthe Hudson issue on Windows and made a good deal of progress on getting Thandy<br />\nset up, understanding the different roles and responsibilities of each in the<br />\nThandy system.

    "content": "<p>I was asked to give a five minute speech to open a panel in front of a number of policy makers and advisors in Washington, DC in the past few weeks.  The discussion was under <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chatham House Rule</a>.  A number of people have encouraged me to publish the speech notes as a blog post, it is as follows.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here I am, a technologist in a room full of policy people.  I'll stick<br />\nto what I know and try not to put anyone to sleep in the next five<br />\nminutes.</p>\n<p>Technology is agnostic, who uses and how they use it matters.  Roads,<br />\ncars, phones, email, websites are all technologies used for good and bad.<br />\nIn the 1930s, the feds and police warned of mass chaos if the interstate<br />\nhighway system was built in the US.  The ability for criminals to quickly<br />\ntransit between cities was of grave concern. Crime would spread faster,<br />\nfurther, and this would hasten the breakdown of the very fabric of the<br />\nAmerican society, community. Time has shown the benefits vastly outweighed<br />\nthe costs.  This same principle has shown to be true of the internet<br />\nand computer technology.  Sure, we may have new kinds of crime with botnets,<br />\nzombies, phishing, but do we really?  Lying, impersonation, and tricking<br />\nsomeone into doing your work are the same crimes they have been for the<br />\npast few millenia.  It's just that the substrate that is used, has changed.<br />\nWhat are some of the largest companies in the world?  GE, IBM, Apple,<br />\nMicrosoft, Google.  What one should or should not do is policy and law,<br />\nwhat one can actually do or not do is technology.</p>\n<p>Circumvention, anonymity, and privacy tools used in a free world can be<br />\na minor annoyance, i.e. wikileaks used wikis, ssl, email, and yes, tor,<br />\nbut in the end, it's an annoyance.  We don't have people in the streets<br />\nrioting trying to overthrow our govt. Wikipedia uses the same technology<br />\nin wikis, ssl, and email. Everyone loves Wikipedia and considers it a net positive.</p>\n<p>The same circumvention, anonymity, and privacy tools are deadly to<br />\nrepressive regimes.  The free flow of information and education are of<br />\ngreat concern to a regime trying to control the horizontal and vertical<br />\nof every day life. The tactics a regime can use are legal, technical,<br />\nand physical.  The regime can switch between tactics, generally<br />\ndepending upon what's economical and most effective.</p>\n<p>Roughly 1 billion people are online in some way.  Berkman did a study<br />\nthat found roughly 2% of that billion know what a proxy is, or even that<br />\ntechnology exists to circumvent internet censorship.  98% of the world<br />\naccepts that facebook, google, cnn, and the bbc, are blocked and doesn't<br />\ntry to find ways around it. This doesn't even broach the topic of online<br />\nprivacy relating to commercial entities nor law enforcement and<br />\nintelligence agencies trying to learn the who, what, where, and how of your Internet activities.</p>\n<p>Arguing about which proxy technology should get all of the funding and<br />\nattention is silly.  The budgets and adversaries vastly outweigh the<br />\nfunding and research into proxies.  It's not a zero-sum game, and<br />\nthe different technologies take very different approaches to success;<br />\nfreegate/ultrasurf, vpns, psiphon, and web proxies play a game of cat<br />\nand mouse with ip addresses and sometimes encryption; tor uses the<br />\nstrategy of R&amp;D and protecting ones anonymity and privacy first, the<br />\nsecondary effects of this are well-suited to circumvention too.  Tor,<br />\nfreegate, psiphon, and vpns sum up to roughly $50m in funding from the US govt<br />\nof the past few years.  Only a very small fraction of that total has made it to actual technology.  Compare that to the billions spent on snakeoil<br />\nblack box technology by the DoD and intelligence agencies preparing for<br />\na cyberwar arms race, much like the nuclear arms race, to deter other<br />\nnations from attacking us.</p>\n<p>I talked to a member of a terrorist organization in Vietnam.  He's been<br />\nstalked, harassed, and had everything confiscated multiple times by his<br />\ngovernment.  You know his organization as Deutsche Welle.  He's a<br />\nreporter.  He had no idea how his plans, documents, and contacts were<br />\nbeing discovered and used against him. His ability to understand the<br />\ndifferences between Tor, JAP, and Freegate was like asking which tires<br />\nare best for gravel, snow, or tarmac.  The question he didn't even know<br />\nto ask is, \"What are safe and secure computing and online practices?\"<br />\nto use my analogy, \"what car do I want for those tires?  the answer is<br />\na rally car.\"   I spent 4 hours going over how the internet works,<br />\nhow to think about adversaries online, what is ssl, what it means, what<br />\nare phishing, viruses, botnets, and state-sponsored malware.  By the<br />\nend of the 4th hour, he understood how tor is different than a simple<br />\nvpn or proxy server, and when to use tor and when it isn't needed. 3.5h<br />\nof that discussion was basic operational, computer, and online security<br />\nand safe practices.</p>\n<p>So where does this leave us?  It leaves us with a mix of education,<br />\ntechnology, and many, many unanswered questions.  This is a young field<br />\noverall.  As the censorship providers and technologies get better, so<br />\nwill those circumvention technologies.  Educating users about internet<br />\nsafety, risks, and making the tools vastly easier and safer to use<br />\nshould be a goal.</p>\n<p>Tor published a \"10 things to think about circumvention tools\" paper to<br />\ntry to distill what we've learned over the past 10 years of doing this.<br />\nIn a few of these areas, tor is not the best choice, for now.</p>\n<p>What about technology?  Isn't it going to save us all?  Currently,<br />\nfreegate/ultrasurf, vpns, and web proxies are looking for money to fund<br />\ntheir growing infrastructure costs. The more users you have, the more<br />\nservers, more bandwidth, and more costs you incur.  Its a quick way to<br />\nspend lots of money and get lots of users.  However becoming the ISP for<br />\nthe world gets very expensive, very quickly as you scale up to hundreds<br />\nof millions of users.  Look at the infrastructures of google, facebook,<br />\nyahoo, and microsoft to see the challenges that lie ahead for these tools.</p>\n<p>Tor and \"distributed tools\" look to improve the research and development<br />\nand rely on the scaling of users to both provide the circumvention and<br />\ngrow to become a self-sustaining ISP to the world.  We have only begun<br />\nto see the power and effects of these technologies with bittorrent, jap,<br />\nskype, freenet, i2p, and tor.</p></blockquote>"

    "content": "<p>Tor 0.2.2.23-alpha lets relays record their bandwidth history so when<br />\n  they restart they don't lose their bandwidth capacity estimate. This<br />\n  release also fixes a diverse set of user-facing bugs, ranging from<br />\n  relays overrunning their rate limiting to clients falsely warning about<br />\n  clock skew to bridge descriptor leaks by our bridge directory authority.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://torproject.org/download/download\" title=\"https://torproject.org/download/download\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://torproject.org/download/download</a></p>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop sending a CLOCK_SKEW controller status event whenever<br />\n      we fetch directory information from a relay that has a wrong clock.<br />\n      Instead, only inform the controller when it's a trusted authority<br />\n      that claims our clock is wrong. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha; fixes<br />\n      the rest of bug 1074.</li>\n<li>Fix an assert in parsing router descriptors containing IPv6<br />\n      addresses. This one took down the directory authorities when<br />\n      somebody tried some experimental code. Bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha.</li>\n<li>Make the bridge directory authority refuse to answer directory<br />\n      requests for \"all\" descriptors. It used to include bridge<br />\n      descriptors in its answer, which was a major information leak.<br />\n      Found by \"piebeer\". Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>\n<li>If relays set RelayBandwidthBurst but not RelayBandwidthRate,<br />\n      Tor would ignore their RelayBandwidthBurst setting,<br />\n      potentially using more bandwidth than expected. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.0.1-alpha. Reported by Paul Wouters. Fixes bug 2470.</li>\n<li>Ignore and warn if the user mistakenly sets \"PublishServerDescriptor<br />\n      hidserv\" in her torrc. The 'hidserv' argument never controlled<br />\n      publication of hidden service descriptors. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  <strong>Major features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relays now save observed peak bandwidth throughput rates to their<br />\n      state file (along with total usage, which was already saved)<br />\n      so that they can determine their correct estimated bandwidth on<br />\n      restart. Resolves bug 1863, where Tor relays would reset their<br />\n      estimated bandwidth to 0 after restarting.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities now take changes in router IP address and<br />\n      ORPort into account when determining router stability. Previously,<br />\n      if a router changed its IP or ORPort, the authorities would not<br />\n      treat it as having any downtime for the purposes of stability<br />\n      calculation, whereas clients would experience downtime since the<br />\n      change could take a while to propagate to them. Resolves issue 1035.</li>\n<li>Enable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution<br />\n      Prevention (DEP) by default on Windows to make it harder for<br />\n      attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. Patch from John Brooks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  <strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.1.x and earlier):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a rare crash bug that could occur when a client was configured<br />\n      with a large number of bridges. Fixes bug 2629; bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.1.2-alpha. Bugfix by trac user \"shitlei\".</li>\n<li>Avoid a double mark-for-free warning when failing to attach a<br />\n      transparent proxy connection. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha. Fixes<br />\n      bug 2279.</li>\n<li>Correctly detect failure to allocate an OpenSSL BIO. Fixes bug 2378;<br />\n      found by \"cypherpunks\". This bug was introduced before the first<br />\n      Tor release, in svn commit r110.</li>\n<li>Country codes aren't supported in EntryNodes until 0.2.3.x, so<br />\n      don't mention them in the manpage. Fixes bug 2450; issue<br />\n      spotted by keb and G-Lo.</li>\n<li>Fix a bug in bandwidth history state parsing that could have been<br />\n      triggered if a future version of Tor ever changed the timing<br />\n      granularity at which bandwidth history is measured. Bugfix on<br />\n      Tor 0.1.1.11-alpha.</li>\n<li>When a relay decides that its DNS is too broken for it to serve<br />\n      as an exit server, it advertised itself as a non-exit, but<br />\n      continued to act as an exit. This could create accidental<br />\n      partitioning opportunities for users. Instead, if a relay is<br />\n      going to advertise reject *:* as its exit policy, it should<br />\n      really act with exit policy \"reject *:*\". Fixes bug 2366.<br />\n      Bugfix on Tor 0.1.2.5-alpha. Bugfix by user \"postman\" on trac.</li>\n<li>In the special case where you configure a public exit relay as your<br />\n      bridge, Tor would be willing to use that exit relay as the last<br />\n      hop in your circuit as well. Now we fail that circuit instead.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.0.12-alpha. Fixes bug 2403. Reported by \"piebeer\".</li>\n<li>Fix a bug with our locking implementation on Windows that couldn't<br />\n      correctly detect when a file was already locked. Fixes bug 2504,<br />\n      bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>\n<li>Fix IPv6-related connect() failures on some platforms (BSD, OS X).<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes first part of bug 2660. Patch by<br />\n      \"piebeer\".</li>\n<li>Set target port in get_interface_address6() correctly. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.1.1.4-alpha and 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes second part of bug 2660.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities are now more robust to hops back in time<br />\n      when calculating router stability. Previously, if a run of uptime<br />\n      or downtime appeared to be negative, the calculation could give<br />\n      incorrect results. Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha; noticed when fixing<br />\n      bug 1035.</li>\n<li>Fix an assert that got triggered when using the TestingTorNetwork<br />\n      configuration option and then issuing a GETINFO config-text control<br />\n      command. Fixes bug 2250; bugfix on 0.2.1.2-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  <strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.2.x):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clients should not weight BadExit nodes as Exits in their node<br />\n      selection. Similarly, directory authorities should not count BadExit<br />\n      bandwidth as Exit bandwidth when computing bandwidth-weights.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.2.10-alpha; fixes bug 2203.</li>\n<li>Correctly clear our dir_read/dir_write history when there is an<br />\n      error parsing any bw history value from the state file. Bugfix on<br />\n      Tor 0.2.2.15-alpha.</li>\n<li>Resolve a bug in verifying signatures of directory objects<br />\n      with digests longer than SHA1. Bugfix on 0.2.2.20-alpha.<br />\n      Fixes bug 2409. Found by \"piebeer\".</li>\n<li>Bridge authorities no longer crash on SIGHUP when they try to<br />\n      publish their relay descriptor to themselves. Fixes bug 2572. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.2.22-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  <strong>Minor features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Log less aggressively about circuit timeout changes, and improve<br />\n      some other circuit timeout messages. Resolves bug 2004.</li>\n<li>Log a little more clearly about the times at which we're no longer<br />\n      accepting new connections. Resolves bug 2181.</li>\n<li>Reject attempts at the client side to open connections to private<br />\n      IP addresses (like 127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.1, and so on) with<br />\n      a randomly chosen exit node. Attempts to do so are always<br />\n      ill-defined, generally prevented by exit policies, and usually<br />\n      in error. This will also help to detect loops in transparent<br />\n      proxy configurations. You can disable this feature by setting<br />\n      \"ClientRejectInternalAddresses 0\" in your torrc.</li>\n<li>Always treat failure to allocate an RSA key as an unrecoverable<br />\n      allocation error.</li>\n<li>Update to the March 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  <strong>Minor features (log subsystem):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add documentation for configuring logging at different severities in<br />\n      different log domains. We've had this feature since 0.2.1.1-alpha,<br />\n      but for some reason it never made it into the manpage. Fixes<br />\n      bug 2215.</li>\n<li>Make it simpler to specify \"All log domains except for A and B\".<br />\n      Previously you needed to say \"[*,~A,~B]\". Now you can just say<br />\n      \"[~A,~B]\".</li>\n<li>Add a \"LogMessageDomains 1\" option to include the domains of log<br />\n      messages along with the messages. Without this, there's no way<br />\n      to use log domains without reading the source or doing a lot<br />\n      of guessing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  <strong>Packaging changes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stop shipping the Tor specs files and development proposal documents<br />\n      in the tarball. They are now in a separate git repository at<br />\n      git://git.torproject.org/torspec.git</li>\n</ul>"

This patch needs some cleanup before being deployed on<br />\nBridgeDB.</li>\n<li>Karsten wrote a first draft of a BridgeDB specification that Nick<br />\ncommented on. The next step is to include Nick's comments and change the<br />\nwriting style, so that the specification describes what the current BridgeDB<br />\ncode does, not what a generic BridgeDB implemention should do.</li>\n<li>Karsten extended the bridge descriptor sanitizing algorithm to include IP<br />\n   address hashes in the sanitized descriptors.  Sanitized all existing<br />\n   bridge descriptors using this new algorithm.  Instead of 127.0.0.1,<br />\n   bridges now have 10.x.y.z addresses with x.y.z being stable for a given<br />\n   bridge fingerprint in a given month.  This allows analyses of how often<br />\n   bridges change their IP addresses in a given month.</li>\n<li>Christian deployed a new version of BridgeDB, the one that's i18n enabled<br />\n(#1613) and also can dump bridge pool assignments to files. We can now<br />\nassign an amount of unassigned bridges to someone/something and dump<br />\nthem to file buckets. See #1612 for more infos. In theory, we can now<br />\nhave an amount of Twitter assigned bridges that we pump out over<br />\nTwitter. </li>\n<li>Christian also started writing a python script that is able to dump<br />\nstuff to Twitter.</li>\n<li>After deployment of the new BridgeDB, some issues came up that were fixed<br />\n(#2556 and others). It seems to run smoothly now. We'll be even more<br />\nhappy about it when we have important (read: Chinese and Farsi)<br />\ntranslations ready and deployed.</li>\n<li>Christian and Karsten discussed about whether his planned \"dump bridge<br />\npool<br />\nassignments to files\" feature can use the bucket mechanism of #1612.<br />\nTurns out it can't since both have a different set of goals and would<br />\nbe to painful to sync with every change.</li>\n<li>Mike helped Karsten with improving the output of Torperf for future<br />\nexperiments involving circuit build timeouts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved Torperf and finally deployed it to collect data about used<br />\n   paths and to measure performance with custom guard node selections.<br />\n   This is still work in progress together with Mike and Tom as part of<br />\n   our first Scrum iteration that ends on March 5.</li>\n<li>Worked on Florian's and Björn's token bucket patch some more together<br />\n   with Sebastian.  The current state of the patch is that it needs some<br />\n   more love before it can be merged into 0.2.3.x.</li>\n<li>Nick collaborated a little with two volunteers on what we<br />\nthink at this point must be the 5th generation of a \"launch a private<br />\nnetwork\" tool.  This one is called \"chutney\". </li>\n<li>Nick reviewed a bunch of patches, reviewed a bunch of bugs, fixed a<br />\nbunch of bugs, merged many people's code, got 0.2.2.x closer to done.</li>\n<li>Sebastian wrote a proposal for a safer voting process for consensus<br />\nparameters, and wrote an implementation for it.<br />\n<a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/178-param-\" title=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/178-param-\">https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/178-param...</a><br />\nvoting.txt</li>\n<li>Damian started thinking about our various projects in a more streamlined<br />\nand easy-to-understand way.  The results are at<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en#Projects\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en#Projects\">https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en#Projects</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Incentives</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Christian cleaned up the rather hackish installation of Weather on bahri.<br />\nThe stable installation now lives under `/home/weather/opt/current' and actually<br />\nis update-able through `git pull'. There's also a testing installation to test<br />\nstuff and play around at <a href=\"https://weather2.torproject.org/\" title=\"https://weather2.torproject.org/\">https://weather2.torproject.org/</a>. He's tried to<br />\nupdate the documentation with all the stuff that is necessary to install and run<br />\nWeather.</li>\n<li>Christian tried looking into #2467. Some people complained that Weather<br />\ndidn't know their relay fingerprint. On Sebastian's and Mike's idea, Christian<br />\nchanged the torrc to include `FetchDirInfoEarly 1' and `FetchUselessDescriptors<br />\n1'. Since that no one complained again about Weather not knowing a certain relay<br />\n(except for one time, when the Weather process had silently crashed and<br />\ntherefore the database wasn't updated for a day). </li>\n<li>After Tor 0.2.1.30 was tagged and made it to the recommended versions',<br />\npeople running 0.2.1.29 started complaining about getting \"Node out of date!\"<br />\nemails from Weather. It turned out that Weather was actually doing the right<br />\nthing, namely mailing them that they were not running the latest recommended<br />\nstable version anymore. No one seemed to have read the text near the checkbox in<br />\nthe signup process. After discussing this intensely with Sebastian, we decided<br />\nto go for a more simple solution: People now get email when they don't run one<br />\nof the recommended versions or a more recent dev version of Tor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>More reliable downloads</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Christian did a rather large GetTor overhaul. The way GetTor manages its<br />\npackages is now much easier to understand and enhance. GetTor moved from a<br />\nini-style configuration file and parser to a more BridgeDB-like configuration<br />\nmanagement.  Also, packages are now configured rather than hard coded. In<br />\naddition, he cleaned up the i18n management of GetTor to something similar to<br />\nwhat we use in BridgeDB. Not only are the translation strings cleaner now, but<br />\nthe translation and installation is smoother. Also, the logging was simplified<br />\nbecause it had too many features that no one used and generally was polluting<br />\nthe log file with too much useless information. Furthermore, the MakeStat.py<br />\nscript that<br />\ncreates GetTor's package statistics was simplified a lot.</li>\n<li>Christian fixed #1586, users requesting non-existent split packages now<br />\nare informed about that fact.</li>\n<li>Nick worked on a thandy packaging spec with Erinn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Translations</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sebastian Started figuring out a way how translations can be pulled from<br />\ntransifex and used in their respective products in a more automated<br />\nfashion.</li>\n<li>New or updated website translations in French, Russian, Italian, Japanese,<br />\nSpanish, Mandarin Chinese, and Greek.</li>\n</ul>"

    "content": "<p><small><i>Thanks to Ian Gallagher, Seth Schoen, Jesse Burns, Chris Palmer, and other anonymous birds for their invaluable feedback on this writeup.</i></small></p>\n<p>The Tor Project has long understood that the <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Certificate_authority\">certification authority</a> (CA) model of trust on the internet is susceptible to various methods of compromise. Without strong anonymity, the ability to perform targeted attacks with the blessing of a CA key is serious. In the past, I’ve worked on <a href=\"http://www.win.tue.nl/hashclash/rogue-ca/\">attacks relating to SSL/TLS trust models</a> and for quite some time, I’ve hunted for evidence of non-academic CA compromise in the wild.</p>\n<p>I’ve also looked for special kinds of cooperation between CAs and browsers. Proof of collusion will give us facts. It will also give us a real understanding of the faith placed in the strength of the underlying systems.</p>\n<p>Does certificate revocation really work? <a href=\"http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/03/18/revocation.html\"><b>No, it does not</b></a>. How much faith does a vendor actually put into revocation, when verifiable evidence of malice is detected or known? Not much, and that’s the subject of this writing.</p>\n<p>Last week, a smoking gun came into sight: A Certification Authority appeared to be compromised in some capacity, and the attacker issued themselves valid HTTPS certificates for high-value web sites. With these certificates, the attacker could impersonate the identities of the victim web sites or other related systems, probably undetectably for the majority of users on the internet.</p>\n<p>I watch the Chromium and Mozilla Firefox projects carefully, because they are so important to the internet infrastructure. On the evening of 16 March, I noticed a very interesting code change to Chromium: <a href=\"http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/net/base/x509_certificate.cc?view=markup&amp;pathrev=78478\">revision 78478, Thu Mar 17 00:48:21 2011 UTC</a>.</p>\n<p>In this revision, the developers added X509Certificate::IsBlacklisted, which returns true if a HTTPS certificate has one of these particular serial numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>047ecbe9fca55f7bd09eae36e10cae1e\n<li>d8f35f4eb7872b2dab0692e315382fb0\n<li>b0b7133ed096f9b56fae91c874bd3ac0\n<li>9239d5348f40d1695a745470e1f23f43\n<li>d7558fdaf5f1105bb213282b707729a3\n<li>f5c86af36162f13a64f54f6dc9587c06\n</ul>\n<p>A comment marks the first as \"Not a real certificate. For testing only.\" but we don’t know if this means the other certificates are or are not also for testing.</p>\n<p>With just these serial numbers, we are not able to learn much about the certificates that Chromium now blocks. To get more information, I started the <a href=\"https://github.com/ioerror/crlwatch\">crlwatch</a> project. Nearly every certificate contains a reference to a <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Revocation_list\">Certificate Revocation List</a> (CRL). A CRL is a list of certificates that the CA has revoked for whatever reason. In theory, this means that an attacker is unable to tamper with the certificate to prevent revocation as the browser will check the CRL it finds in a certificate. In practice the attacker simply needs to tamper with the network - this is something they’re already able to do if they are performing a SSL/TLS Machine-In-The-Middle attack. Even if an attacker has a certificate, they generally are unable to modify the certificate without breaking the digital signature issued by the CA. That CA signature is what gives the certificate value to an attacker and tampering takes the attacker back to square zero. So while investigating these serials, we clearly lack the CRL distribution point in the Chrome source. However, the project that I announced on March 17th, crlwatch, was specifically written to assist in finding who issued, and potentially revoked the serial numbers in question. By matching the serial numbers found in the source for Chrome with the serial numbers of revoked certificates, we’re able to link specific serials to specific CA issuers. The more serial numbers we match in revocation lists, the higher our probability of having found the CA that issued the certificates.</p>\n<p>About twelve hours (Thursday, March 17, 2011 | 13:00) after the above patch was pushed into source control - Google announced <a href=\"http://googlechromereleases.blogspot.com/2011/03/stable-and-beta-channel-updates_17.html\">an important Chrome Update that involved HTTPS certificate issues</a>.</p>\n<p>This also is mostly uninteresting until we notice that this is not isolated to Google. Mozilla pushed out two patches of interest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/f6215eef2276\">rev-f6215eef2276</a>\n<li><a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/55f344578932\">rev-55f344578932</a>\n</ul>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/f6215eef2276\">complete changeset</a> is semi-informative. Mozilla references a private bug in that fix that Mozilla will hopefully disclose. Similar to Chromium, the Mozilla patches create a list of certificate serial numbers that will be treated as invalid. However, the serial numbers from the Mozilla patches are different:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>009239d5348f40d1695a745470e1f23f43\n<li>00d8f35f4eb7872b2dab0692e315382fb0\n<li>72032105c50c08573d8ea5304efee8b0\n<li>00b0b7133ed096f9b56fae91c874bd3ac0\n<li>00e9028b9578e415dc1a710a2b88154447\n<li>00d7558fdaf5f1105bb213282b707729a3\n<li>047ecbe9fca55f7bd09eae36e10cae1e\n<li>00f5c86af36162f13a64f54f6dc9587c06\n<li>392a434f0e07df1f8aa305de34e0c229\n<li>3e75ced46b693021218830ae86a82a71\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, both Mozilla and Google shipped similar patches to their code at roughly the same time. The two browsers now have partially overlapping certificate blocklists. Here is the union of the two lists:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>009239d5348f40d1695a745470e1f23f43\n<li>00b0b7133ed096f9b56fae91c874bd3ac0\n<li>00d7558fdaf5f1105bb213282b707729a3\n<li>00d8f35f4eb7872b2dab0692e315382fb0\n<li>00e9028b9578e415dc1a710a2b88154447\n<li>00f5c86af36162f13a64f54f6dc9587c06\n<li>047ecbe9fca55f7bd09eae36e10cae1e\n<li>392a434f0e07df1f8aa305de34e0c229\n<li>3e75ced46b693021218830ae86a82a71\n<li>72032105c50c08573d8ea5304efee8b0\n<li>9239d5348f40d1695a745470e1f23f43\n<li>b0b7133ed096f9b56fae91c874bd3ac0\n<li>d7558fdaf5f1105bb213282b707729a3\n<li>d8f35f4eb7872b2dab0692e315382fb0\n<li>f5c86af36162f13a64f54f6dc9587c06\n</ul>\n<p>Why do the browsers have these blocklists, and why don’t they have the same blocklists?</p>\n<p>This returns me to the reason for creating crlwatch last week - I wanted to find the someones who knowingly revoked the above listed special certificates. Anyone looking from the same starting point as I did, obviously lacks the leaf certificates in question and as a result, I had to look in a rather round about manner. Thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/observatory\">EFF’s SSL Observatory</a>, I was able to populate the base list for crlwatch. Armed with a nearly canonical list of all CRLs, I fetched them over <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">Tor</a> and parsed the CRL data into human readable text. The goal was to search for the above serial numbers and to find something linkable.</p>\n<p>This is the result from searching the crlwatch data:</p>\n<p><code><br />\nLooking for 009239d5348f40d1695a745470e1f23f43 in parsed CRLs...<br />\nLooking for 00b0b7133ed096f9b56fae91c874bd3ac0 in parsed CRLs...<br />\nLooking for 00d7558fdaf5f1105bb213282b707729a3 in parsed CRLs...<br />\nLooking for 00d8f35f4eb7872b2dab0692e315382fb0 in parsed CRLs...<br />\nLooking for 00e9028b9578e415dc1a710a2b88154447 in parsed CRLs...<br />\nLooking for 00f5c86af36162f13a64f54f6dc9587c06 in parsed CRLs...<br />\nLooking for 047ecbe9fca55f7bd09eae36e10cae1e in parsed CRLs...<br />\nMatch!

If I had to make a bet, I'd wager that an attacker was able to issue high value certificates, probably by compromising USERTRUST in some manner, this was discovered sometime before the revocation date, each certificate was revoked, the vendors notified, the patches were written, and binary builds kicked off - end users are probably still updating and thus many people are vulnerable to the failure that is the CRL and OCSP method for revocation. Even after users update, I'm guessing they may be unequally protected.  Mozilla and other browsers should force OCSP verification by default as part of their next release and remove CAs that are unable to handle this requirement. Users of Mozilla Firefox that are concerned about this issue should enable security.OCSP.require in the about:config dialog. The surveillance concerns of enabling OCSP are serious - a CA learns what sites you’re visiting. However, they are nullified by the fact that OCSP checking is enabled by default on Firefox at least; it simply doesn’t provide any security gains for the end user because when it fails, it fails open!</p>\n<p>I contacted both Google and Mozilla (<a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=643056\">bug #643056</a>) for comment after discovering the above data. Mozilla expressed some concern about disclosure and I offered to embargo this document until Tuesday March 22nd, the launch day for Firefox 4. They agreed and I kept this under my hat. After discussions between Comodo and Microsoft, passed on to me by Mozilla, the embargo was to be extended until Wednesday, March 23rd. This extension was ostensibly to ensure that Microsoft would be able to ship their Internet Explorer mitigation pack. After further discussion, Mozilla <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.com/security/2011/03/22/firefox-blocking-fraudulent-certificates/\">pushed their blog post about the issue</a> and I now consider the embargo lifted. Google has already shipped a fix to users. Install the latest Firefox to get a patch, if you haven't already. A Tor Browser update is in the works and will be available soon.</p>\n<p>Mozilla offered some additional information and disclosed that <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/\">addons.mozilla.org</a> was one of the certificates acquired by the attacker. In total, nine certificates were acquired. Seven were uniquely named. Two of the certificates were re-issued for a previously issued host name. One certificate was issued for \"global trustee\" rather than a valid host name. With testing certificates in the list, we have a good accounting of the certificates found in the source code of each browser. Google clarified their discrepancy with the list, acknowledged the duplicate serial mistake and issued subsequent patches. Saving for test hosts, the lists are now identical.</p>\n<p>If I had to guess at sites, I'd speculate that Facebook, Skype, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and others are worthy of targeting. Comodo should disclose this information and clear up this speculation with very clear information about who was targeted.</p>\n<p>Both vendors expressed that the CA in question had done something quite remarkable by disclosing this compromise. The incentives may not be in the favor of the CA for disclosure. Many CAs may fall to similar attacks and simply refuse to disclose. Hopefully crlwatch will provide us with meaningful data regarding revocation events. The EFF and The Tor Project are <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/HTTPSEverywhere/SSLObservatorySubmission\">working on solutions for detecting anomalies in certificates</a> found in the wild. Still, some CAs may simply be unaware of compromises or unwilling to revoke for fear of detection.</p>\n<p>Are all other browsers deploying similar countermeasures? Thanks to the free software nature of Firefox and Chrome, we have an answer for at least two projects. I wish that we could say the same for the rest of the browser world. One may assume that the CA in question did their best to contact all impacted vendors and targets.</p>\n<p>Comodo has not yet revealed the extent of the compromise to the public - were their signing keys in a hardware security module? How many certificates in total were ever issued by this specific signing key? Wouldn't it be best to remove the specific signing keys from all trust roots to be extra careful given the stakes? Who exactly did they deem important enough for disclosure? The Tor Project, which ships the Tor Browser Bundle was not notified. Clearly some groups are being left out of the loop and this is where even a single attack really causes the entire CA trust model to fall apart.</p>\n<p>Comodo should release the full certificates to the internet as well as all of the details relating to the attack. Mozilla and other browsers should open their bug reports, explain their process and lay out a path forward where we won't have to repeat this entire process again.</p>\n<p>There is some suspicion that this action was taken by a state level adversary and there are some specific states that have been named. I’ll leave further speculation about which nation states may be involved to others. The mere fact that the web’s system of trust relies on an all or nothing property should be enough of a cause for alarm. It’s obvious that this has been and will continue to be exploited.</p>\n<p>The impact on other cryptographic systems, such as S/MIME signatures and other cryptographic systems secured by CAs is entirely un-discussed. Quite seriously, when a CA is compromised, it will impact a great deal more than the web; users of email systems (SMTP, IMAP, POP,etc), Jabber servers, and any other SSL/TLS enabled systems are all at risk. Blocking specific serial numbers or relying on flawed, <a href=\"http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/03/18/revocation.html\">provably broken methods of revocation</a> will simply not cut it anymore. When the actual protection mechanisms are not enforced, there is little hope of end users being protected.</p>\n<p>This should serve as a wake up call to the internet. We need to research, build, and share new methods for ensuring trust, identity, authenticity, and confidentiality on the internet. Proposals such as <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-dane-protocol-06.txt\">DANE</a>, <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hallambaker-donotissue-03\">CAA</a>, <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-hoffman-server-has-tls-04\">HASTLS</a>, and <a href=\"http://web.monkeysphere.info/\">Monkeysphere</a> are steps in the right direction but they face an uphill battle from entrenched economic interests. </p>\n<p>Certification Authorities may continue to provide a piece of the puzzle but it’s high time we ensure that they’re not the alpha and the omega, anymore.</p>\n<p><b><a name=\"Update\">Update</a>:</b><br />\nComodo has issued <a href=\"http://www.comodo.com/Comodo-Fraud-Incident-2011-03-23.html\">a statement confirming everything</a> that I've said and more. They believe that this was a targeted attack by a state level actor and they have named Iran as the country they suspect. Mozilla has now opened the bug reports about the issue to the public. Microsoft has now <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/2524375.mspx\">disclosed their report</a> as well.</p>\n<p>In the details of their statement we have a confirmation that they have the ability to monitor and thus surveille people who wish to know if certificates are valid.</p>\n<p>Comodo also clearly demonstrate a mis-understanding - they believe that checks for revocation are proof positive that certificates are being used. They need to <b><a href=\"http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/03/18/revocation.html\">read and understand why this is not true</a></b>.</p>\n<p>The browsers have dropped the ball and they have chosen to fail open in nearly every single case; an attacker who is able to MITM SSL/TLS will also MITM the OCSP/CRL requests. Moxie's <a href=\"http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip/\">sslstrip</a> demonstrated that an attacker would do this automatically and his software has done this for OCSP in public since 2009. Mozilla did not fix this issue at the time and they have once again punted on the issue. An even <a href=\"http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/03/18/revocation.html\">lower tech attack is possible and it's why revocation does not work</a>: <b>By returning a HTTP 500 error, the browser will the continue on as if revocation checks showed the certificate to be perfectly fine</b>.</p>\n<p>The browsers chose a user privacy invasive stance without the user protecting security properties. They did this because they claim that CAs are unable to provide working OCSP/CRL systems for request handling. This is a fair claim if true but it must not stand any longer. If the CA cannot provide even a basic level of revocation, it's clearly <b>irresponsible</b> to ship that CA root in a browser. <b>Browsers should give insecure CA keys an Internet Death Sentence</b> rather than expose the users of the browsers to known problems.</p>\n<p>It's probably the case that Mozilla and other browsers should write a secure, caching OCSP server for use when a CA has a failure. It should probably be run by a neutral third party such as the EFF with a strong user privacy stance. This would only serve as a temporary fix and until Browsers get their act together, users are doomed anyway.</p>\n<p>OCSP stapling does not fix this issue. The browsers treat revocation errors as soft errors and a MITM is deadly for revocation. The browsers believe they have to treat them as soft errors because the CAs are failing to do their job properly and are almost entirely unaccountable. The browsers are failing users by refusing to hold CAs to account. If OCSP and CRL failures mean the internet doesn't work, we need to create alternatives and not simply sweep these issues under the rug for later analysis. <b>Browsers should hard fail on certificate revocation errors.</b></p>\n<p>Comodo has further failed by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Failing to produce further information about those certificates\n<li>Selective disclosure to \"<i>principal browsers and domain owners</i>\"\n<li>Failing to disclose what sub-CA/intermediate root actually did the signing\n<li>Believing that the attacker must control DNS for these attacks to succeed\n<li>Waiting <b>eight days</b> to disclose evidence of a specific targeted attack\n</ul>\n<p>I believe that the browsers, such as Mozilla, are doing the best that they can in some ways but the lack of immediate full disclosure is a major failure.</p>"

    "content": "<p>I visited Taipei for several days at the end of March to do some Tor talks and generally spread the Tor gospel to another near-China country. I ended up doing five Tor talks in three days.</p>\n<p>The motivation was to find technical people in Taiwan and teach them more about the problems that Tor is facing, so they can be aware of these issues as they do their own part to make the world a safer place. I visited Hong Kong a few years ago, and did a talk at Hong Kong University as well as some meetings with human rights people. Many people I met said \"if you want policy people, go to Hong Kong; if you want technical people, go to Taiwan.\" So I did.</p>\n<p>The first talk was at the <a href=\"http://osdc.tw/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Source Developers Conference</a> (OSDC 2011). I had a 75 minute keynote slot, and there were perhaps 200 people in the audience &mdash; mostly industry people with an interest in free software. Some of the participants, like <a href=\"http://mmnet.iis.sinica.edu.tw/~syhu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shun-Yun Hu</a>, were quite technical and would make great local Tor advocates. I also got a chance to teach other speakers like <a href=\"http://ingy.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ingy</a> and <a href=\"http://fsck.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jesse Vincent</a> about what needs doing in Tor-land.</p>\n<p>The second talk was to a group of 30 or 40 graduate students and professors at <a href=\"http://www.ntu.edu.tw/engv4/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Táidà</a>, the main Taiwanese university. They understood the security angles better than the OSDC audience, but what surprised me most was how few of them were aware of the recent political events in the Middle East. One of the most valuable aspects of Tor from an academic perspective is how it is a role model for security research influencing broader society.</p>\n<p>The third talk was to a group of human rights activists and nonprofit organizers. I've left out names to protect the innocent; let me know if you need an introduction and I'd be happy to connect you. There were some very interesting lawyers, as well as more technical activists who work hard to make sure that Taiwan remains a free society.</p>\n<p>The fourth talk was at the Institute of Information Science at <a href=\"http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Academia Sinica</a>, the main Taiwanese research institution. I met with <a href=\"http://www.cryptojedi.org/users/peter/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Schwabe</a>, a crypto post-doc who works with <a href=\"http://cr.yp.to/djb.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">djb</a>. I also did an interview for the <a href=\"http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/page/research/OpenSourceSoftwareFoundry.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Source Software Foundry</a> &mdash; Taiwan's government-sponsored free software advocacy and education organization. You won't find one of those in the United States!</p>\n<p>My last talk was to the <a href=\"http://www.tossug.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taipei Open Source Software User Group</a> (TOSSUG), a group of 10 or 20 quite smart technical folks. They were by far my best audience in terms of understanding the technical side and also knowing why Tor is relevant to their society. Hopefully we'll get some volunteer developers and/or <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/gsoc\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Summer of Code</a> students.</p>\n<p>Here are the <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/~arma/slides-osdc11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">slides I used</a>, though the actual content changed from talk to talk. Overall, it was a worthwhile trip: I got to learn more about Taiwan's perspective on China and its censorship (which will help me in future talks and in planning Tor's future), people in Taiwan got to learn more about Tor, and I helped bootstrap a \"human rights and Tor\" community there. I've been invited back for two larger security conferences (in July and August), but alas they probably won't fit into my schedule, since I need to balance my time between advocacy, trainings, and actually getting development work done.</p>\n<p>If you are in Taiwan and want some introductions, or you're somewhere else and want a Tor person to come do some trainings or talks, let me know!</p>"

All \version $Id$ headers have been<br />\n    removed since Git does not support $Id$.</li>\n<li>As part of the move, Vidalia's Trac is now at:<br />\n      <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/\" title=\"https://trac.torproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://trac.torproject.org/</a><br />\n    All Trac numbers in Vidalia 0.2.12 and beyond refer to the new Trac<br />\n    entries.

It<br />\n    can be used for Linux maintainers to build a better default interaction<br />\n    between Tor and Vidalia by just setting the right permissions and file<br />\n    owner on the socket file for the connection. Using ControlSocket means<br />\n    you don't need to worry about authentication methods with ControlPort.<br />\n    Resolves bug 2091.</li>\n<li>Add a way to edit arbitrary torrc entries while Tor is running. Now<br />\n    Vidalia users have more flexibility for configuring Tor. This change<br />\n    doesn't replace editing torrc directly, because on some systems<br />\n    (like Debian) Tor can't write to its torrc file. Resolves bug 2083.</li>\n<li>Remove Vidalia's direct dependency on OpenSSL. This dependency had<br />\n    caused Vidalia to fail to run on FreeBSD (due to a bug in the FreeBSD<br />\n    ports collection) and Fedora 14 (due to an incompatibility between<br />\n    OpenSSL and Fedora's SELinux configuration). Resolves bug 2287 and<br />\n    2611.</li>\n<li>Restore compatibility with Windows 2000. An update to the MiniUPnPc<br />\n    library had introduced an unnecessary dependency on a system library<br />\n    not included in Windows 2000. Fixes bug 2612.</li>\n<li>Fix how the advanced message log window displays message updates when<br />\n    messages are coming in too quickly, for example when you're listening<br />\n    to debug-level messages from Tor. Fixes bug 2093.</li>\n<li>Add a what's this? link to the bridge option to explain in a more verbose<br />\n    fashion what being a bridge involves. Resolves bug 1995.</li>\n<li>Prompt users to restart Tor after changing the path to torrc. Fixes bug<br />\n    2086.</li>\n<li>Disable the directory port configuration field when configuring a<br />\n    bridge. A bridge does not need to operate a separate directory port,<br />\n    and operating one can make a bridge easier to detect. Fixes bug 2431.</li>\n<li>When Vidalia asks Tor for a bridge's usage history before anyone has<br />\n    used it, correctly report that no clients have used the bridge recently.<br />\n    Previously, it would incorrectly warn that it was unable to retrieve the<br />\n    bridge's usage history.

    "content": "<p>Tor 0.2.2.24-alpha fixes a variety of bugs, including a big bug that<br />\n  prevented Tor clients from effectively using \"multihomed\" bridges,<br />\n  that is, bridges that listen on multiple ports or IP addresses so users<br />\n  can continue to use some of their addresses even if others get blocked.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.torproject.org/download/download</a></p>\n<p>  <strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a bug where bridge users who configure the non-canonical<br />\n      address of a bridge automatically switch to its canonical<br />\n      address. If a bridge listens at more than one address, it should be<br />\n      able to advertise those addresses independently and any non-blocked<br />\n      addresses should continue to work. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.x. Fixes<br />\n      bug 2510.</li>\n<li>If you configured Tor to use bridge A, and then quit and<br />\n      configured Tor to use bridge B instead, it would happily continue<br />\n      to use bridge A if it's still reachable. While this behavior is<br />\n      a feature if your goal is connectivity, in some scenarios it's a<br />\n      dangerous bug. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha; fixes bug 2511.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities now use data collected from their own<br />\n      uptime observations when choosing whether to assign the HSDir flag<br />\n      to relays, instead of trusting the uptime value the relay reports in<br />\n      its descriptor. This change helps prevent an attack where a small<br />\n      set of nodes with frequently-changing identity keys can blackhole<br />\n      a hidden service. (Only authorities need upgrade; others will be<br />\n      fine once they do.) Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes bug 2709.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>  <strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When we restart our relay, we might get a successful connection<br />\n      from the outside before we've started our reachability tests,<br />\n      triggering a warning: \"ORPort found reachable, but I have no<br />\n      routerinfo yet. Failing to inform controller of success.\" This<br />\n      bug was harmless unless Tor is running under a controller<br />\n      like Vidalia, in which case the controller would never get a<br />\n      REACHABILITY_SUCCEEDED status event.

Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha. Resolves bug 2716.<br />\n    - Fix an issue that prevented static linking of libevent on<br />\n      some platforms (notably Linux). Fixes bug 2698; bugfix on<br />\n      versions 0.2.1.23/0.2.2.8-alpha (the versions introducing<br />\n      the --with-static-libevent configure option).</li>\n<li>We now ask the other side of a stream (the client or the exit)<br />\n      for more data on that stream when the amount of queued data on<br />\n      that stream dips low enough. Previously, we wouldn't ask the<br />\n      other side for more data until either it sent us more data (which<br />\n      it wasn't supposed to do if it had exhausted its window!) or we<br />\n      had completely flushed all our queued data.

    "content": "<p>A while ago, I wrote up a description of what needs to be done to get Tor to be IPv6-compliant and sent it to the tor-dev mailinglist.  I thought it might be neat to share this on the blog too, so that people know what's left to do before we an call Tor fully IPv6-compliant.</p>\n<p>Currently, I'm hoping that for 0.2.3.x we can at least get to the point where bridges can handle IPv6-only clients and exits can handle IPv6 addresses.  If we get further, that will be even better.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>   This document outlines what we'll have to do to make Tor fully support IPv6.  It refers to other proposals, current and as-yet unwritten.  It suggests a few incremental steps, each of which on its own should make Tor more useful in the brave new IPv6 future of tomorrow.</p>\n<h3>Motivation</h3>\n<p>   Turns out, 4 billion addresses wasn't enough.</p>\n<h3>What needs to change</h3>\n<p>   Tor uses the Internet in many ways.  There are three main ways that will need to change for IPv6 support, from most urgent to least urgent.</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Tor must allow connections from IPv6-only clients. (Currently, routers and bridges do not listen on IPv6 addresses, and can't advertise that they support IPv6 addresses, so clients can't learn that they do.)</li>\n<li>Tor must transport IPv6 traffic and IPv6-related DNS traffic.  (Currently, Tor only allows BEGIN cells to ask for connections        to IPv4 targets or to hostnames, and only allows RESOLVE cells        to request A and PTR records.)</li>\n<li> Tor must allow nodes to connect to one another over IPv6.</li>\n<p>Allowing IPv6-only clients is the most important, since unless we do, these clients will be unable to connect to Tor at all.  Next most important is to support IPv6 DNS related dependencies and exiting to IPv6 services. Finally, allowing Tor nodes to support a   dual stack of both IPv4 and IPv6 for interconnection seems like a   reasonable step towards a fully hybrid v4/v6 Tor network.</p>\n<p>One implementation hurdle that will need to get resolved alongside these changes is to convert uint32_t to tor_addr_t in many more places   in the Tor code, so we can handle addresses being either IPv4 or IPv6.   There are a few cases, e.g. the local router list, where we'll want   to think harder about the resource requirements of keeping tens of   thousands of larger addresses in memory.</p>\n<p>More issues may of course also be discovered as we develop solutions   for these issues, some of which may need to take priority.</p>\n<h3>Designs that we will need to do</h3>\n<p>For IPv6-only clients, we'll need to specify that routers can have   multiple addresses and ORPorts.</p>\n<p>There is an old proposal (118) to try to allow multiple   ORPorts per router.  It's been accepted; it needs to be checked for   correctness, updated to track other changes in more recent Tor   versions, and updated to work with the new microdescriptor designs.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we'll need to audit the designs for all our codebase   for places that might assume that IPs are a scarce resource.  For   example, clients assume that any two routers occupying an IPv4 /16   network are \"too close\" topologically to be used in the same   circuit, and the bridgedb HTTPS distributor assumes that hopping   from one /24 to another takes a little effort for most clients.   The directory authorities assume that blacklisting an IP is an okay   response to a bad router at that address.  These and other places   will instead need more appropriate notions of \"closeness\" and   \"similarity\".</p>\n<p>We'll want to consider geographic and political boundaries rather than   purely mathematical notions such as the size of network blocks.</p>\n<p>We'll need a way to advertise IPv6 bridges, and to use them.</p>\n<p>For transporting IPv6-only traffic, we have another accepted design   proposal (117).  It has some open questions concerning proper   behavior with respect to DNS lookups, and also needs to be checked   and updated to track current Tor designs.</p>\n<p>We do not have a current accepted design proposal for allowing   nodes to connect to each other via IPv6.  Allowing opportunistic   IPv6 traffic between nodes that can communicate with both IPv4 and   IPv6 will be relatively simple, as will be bridges that have only   an IPv6 address: both of these fall out relatively simply from   designing a process for advertising and connecting to IPv6   addresses.  The harder problem is in supporting IPv6-only   Tor routers.  For these, we'll need to consider network topology   issues: having nodes that can't connect to all the other nodes   will weaken one of our basic assumptions for path generation, so   we'll need to make sure to do the analysis enough to tell whether this   is safe.</p>\n<h3>Ready, fire, aim: An alternative methodology</h3>\n<p>At least one volunteer is currently working on IPv6 issues in Tor.   If his efforts go well, it might be that our first design drafts   for some of these open topics arrive concurrently with (or even in   the form of!) alpha code to implement them.  If so, we need to   follow a variant of the design process, extracting design from code   to evaluate it (rather than designing then coding).  Probably,   based on design review, some changes to code would be necessary.</p>"

    "content": "<p>In a random bar about two years ago, a Google Chrome developer asked me why Torbutton didn't just launch a new, clean Firefox profile/instance to deal with the tremendous number of state separation issues. Simply by virtue of him asking me this question, I realized how much better off Chrome was by implementing Incognito Mode this way and how much simpler it must have been for them overall (though they did not/do not deal with anywhere near as many issues as Torbutton does)...</p>\n<p>So I took a deep breath, and explained how the original use model of Torbutton and my initial ignorance at the size of the problem had led me through a series of incremental improvements to address the state isolation issue one item at a time. Since the toggle model was present at the beginning of this vision quest, it was present at the end.</p>\n<p>I realized at that same instant that in hindsight, this decision was monumentally stupid, and that I had been working harder, not smarter. However, I thought then that since we had the toggle model built, we might as well keep it: it allowed people to use their standard issue Firefoxes easily and painlessly with Tor.</p>\n<p>I now no longer believe even this much. I think we should completely do away with the toggle model, as well as the entire idea of Torbutton as a separate piece of user-facing software, and rely solely on the Tor Browser Bundles, except perhaps with the addition of standalone Tor+Vidalia binaries for use by experts and relay operators.</p>\n<p>The Tor Browser Bundles will include Torbutton, but we will no longer recommend that people use Torbutton without Tor Browser. Torbutton will be removed from addons.mozilla.org, and the Torbutton download page will clearly state that it is for experts only. If serious unfixed security issues begin to accumulate against the toggle model, we will stop providing Torbutton xpis at all.</p>\n<p>I believe this shift must be done for a few reasons: some usability, some technical. Since I feel the usability issues trump the technical ones, I'll discuss them first.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the Tor Project doesn't really have funding to conduct official usability studies to help us make the best choice, but I think that even without them, it is pretty clear that this migration is what we must do to improve the status quo.</p>\n<p>I think the average user is horribly confused by both the toggle model and the need to install additional software into Firefox (or conversely, the need to *also* install Tor software onto their computers after they install Torbutton). I also think that the average user is not likely to use this software safely. They are likely to log in to sites over Tor that they shouldn't, forget which tor mode they are in, and forget which mode certain tabs were opened under. These are all nightmare situations for anonymity and privacy.</p>\n<p>On the technical side, several factors are forcing us in the direction of a short-term fork of Firefox. The over-arching issue is that the set of bugfixes required to maintain the toggle model is a superset of those required to maintain the browser model. <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/report/39\">Trac report #39</a> lists the bugs we must fix for the browser model, where as to maintain the toggle model, we must fix bugs from <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/report/14\">trac report #14</a> in addition to the bugs in <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/report/39\">report #39</a>.</p>\n<p>A similar issue exists with <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/torbutton/en/design/#FirefoxBugs\">bugs that must be fixed in Firefox</a>. The Firefox API bugs that need to be addressed to properly support the toggle model include rather esoteric and complicated issues that few groups other than Tor will find useful.</p>\n<p>This means more resistance from Mozilla to get the toggle mode bugs fixed or even merged, less likelihood the fixes will be used elsewhere, and more danger they will succumb to bitrot. As a result, the lag time between fix and deployment for low-priority Firefox bugs can be as long as 3 years. See <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=280661\">Bug 280661</a> for an example.</p>\n<p>The Tor Browser bugs on the other hand are more directly usable by Firefox in its own Private Browsing Mode, which makes them more likely to merge quicker, and be maintained long-term. Also, because we are releasing our own Firefox-based browser, we will also have more control over experimenting with them and deploying these fixes to our users rapidly, as opposed to waiting for the next major Firefox release.</p>\n<p>So, we can either invest effort in improving the UI of Torbutton to better educate users to understand our particular rabbit-hole tunnel-vision of design choices, and also solving crazier Firefox bugs; or we can reconsider our user model and try to simplify our software.</p>\n<p>We don't have the manpower (ie: enough me) to do both. This means we should go with the simpler, easier option.</p>\n<p>We do face a small number of barriers and downsides associated with this plan. We are collecting the issues we need to address ASAP as child tickets of this bug:<br />\n<a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2880\" title=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2880\">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2880</a></p>\n<p>Overall, the downsides seem to mostly apply to expert users and how they will adapt the custom Tor setups they have built. We don't anticipate a lot of long term issues with this group, as most of the configuration options of Torbutton will remain available, and users should still be able to install custom addons and configure their Tor Browser profile however they need (even to the point of running it side-by-side to a system tor instance that is used for non-web applications).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-April/020077.html\">Additional discussion</a> about this issue has occurred on the tor-talk mailinglist.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this announcement doesn't ruin your day!</p>"

    "content": "<p>Tor 0.2.2.25-alpha fixes many bugs: hidden service clients are more<br />\n  robust, routers no longer overreport their bandwidth, Win7 should crash<br />\n  a little less, and NEWNYM (as used by Vidalia's \"new identity\" button)<br />\n  now prevents hidden service-related activity from being linkable. It<br />\n  provides more information to Vidalia so you can see if your bridge is<br />\n  working. Also, 0.2.2.25-alpha revamps the Entry/Exit/ExcludeNodes and<br />\n  StrictNodes configuration options to make them more reliable, more<br />\n  understandable, and more regularly applied. If you use those options,<br />\n  please see the revised documentation for them in the manual page.</p>\n<p>  <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.torproject.org/download/download</a></p>\n<p>  <strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relays were publishing grossly inflated bandwidth values because<br />\n      they were writing their state files wrong--now they write the<br />\n      correct value. Also, resume reading bandwidth history from the<br />\n      state file correctly. Fixes bug 2704; bugfix on 0.2.2.23-alpha.</li>\n<li>Improve hidden service robustness: When we find that we have<br />\n      extended a hidden service's introduction circuit to a relay not<br />\n      listed as an introduction point in the HS descriptor we currently<br />\n      have, retry with an introduction point from the current<br />\n      descriptor. Previously we would just give up. Fixes bugs 1024 and<br />\n      1930; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>\n<li>Clients now stop trying to use an exit node associated with a given<br />\n      destination by TrackHostExits if they fail to reach that exit node.<br />\n      Fixes bug 2999. Bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc.</li>\n<li>Fix crash bug on platforms where gmtime and localtime can return<br />\n      NULL. Windows 7 users were running into this one. Fixes part of bug<br />\n      2077. Bugfix on all versions of Tor. Found by boboper.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Security and stability fixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't double-free a parsable, but invalid, microdescriptor, even if<br />\n      it is followed in the blob we're parsing by an unparsable<br />\n      microdescriptor. Fixes an issue reported in a comment on bug 2954.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha; fix by \"cypherpunks\".</li>\n<li>If the Nickname configuration option isn't given, Tor would pick a<br />\n      nickname based on the local hostname as the nickname for a relay.<br />\n      Because nicknames are not very important in today's Tor and the<br />\n      \"Unnamed\" nickname has been implemented, this is now problematic<br />\n      behavior: It leaks information about the hostname without being<br />\n      useful at all. Fixes bug 2979; bugfix on 0.1.2.2-alpha, which<br />\n      introduced the Unnamed nickname. Reported by tagnaq.</li>\n<li>Fix an uncommon assertion failure when running with DNSPort under<br />\n      heavy load. Fixes bug 2933; bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Avoid linkability based on cached hidden service descriptors: forget<br />\n      all hidden service descriptors cached as a client when processing a<br />\n      SIGNAL NEWNYM command. Fixes bug 3000; bugfix on 0.0.6.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Export GeoIP information on bridge usage to controllers even if we<br />\n      have not yet been running for 24 hours. Now Vidalia bridge operators<br />\n      can get more accurate and immediate feedback about their<br />\n      contributions to the network.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major features and bugfixes (node selection):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Revise and reconcile the meaning of the ExitNodes, EntryNodes,<br />\n      ExcludeEntryNodes, ExcludeExitNodes, ExcludeNodes, and StrictNodes<br />\n      options. Previously, we had been ambiguous in describing what<br />\n      counted as an \"exit\" node, and what operations exactly \"StrictNodes<br />\n      0\" would permit. This created confusion when people saw nodes built<br />\n      through unexpected circuits, and made it hard to tell real bugs from<br />\n      surprises. Now the intended behavior is:\n<ul>\n<li>\"Exit\", in the context of ExitNodes and ExcludeExitNodes, means<br />\n          a node that delivers user traffic outside the Tor network.</li>\n<li>\"Entry\", in the context of EntryNodes, means a node used as the<br />\n          first hop of a multihop circuit. It doesn't include direct<br />\n          connections to directory servers.</li>\n<li>\"ExcludeNodes\" applies to all nodes.</li>\n<li>\"StrictNodes\" changes the behavior of ExcludeNodes only. When<br />\n          StrictNodes is set, Tor should avoid all nodes listed in<br />\n          ExcludeNodes, even when it will make user requests fail. When<br />\n          StrictNodes is *not* set, then Tor should follow ExcludeNodes<br />\n          whenever it can, except when it must use an excluded node to<br />\n          perform self-tests, connect to a hidden service, provide a<br />\n          hidden service, fulfill a .exit request, upload directory<br />\n          information, or fetch directory information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>      Collectively, the changes to implement the behavior fix bug 1090.</li>\n<li>ExcludeNodes now takes precedence over EntryNodes and ExitNodes: if<br />\n      a node is listed in both, it's treated as excluded.</li>\n<li>ExcludeNodes now applies to directory nodes -- as a preference if<br />\n      StrictNodes is 0, or an absolute requirement if StrictNodes is 1.<br />\n      Don't exclude all the directory authorities and set StrictNodes to 1<br />\n      unless you really want your Tor to break.</li>\n<li>ExcludeNodes and ExcludeExitNodes now override exit enclaving.</li>\n<li>ExcludeExitNodes now overrides .exit requests.</li>\n<li>We don't use bridges listed in ExcludeNodes.</li>\n<li>When StrictNodes is 1:\n<ul>\n<li>We now apply ExcludeNodes to hidden service introduction points<br />\n         and to rendezvous points selected by hidden service users. This<br />\n         can make your hidden service less reliable: use it with caution!</li>\n<li>If we have used ExcludeNodes on ourself, do not try relay<br />\n         reachability self-tests.</li>\n<li>If we have excluded all the directory authorities, we will not<br />\n         even try to upload our descriptor if we're a relay.</li>\n<li>Do not honor .exit requests to an excluded node.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Remove a misfeature that caused us to ignore the Fast/Stable flags<br />\n      when ExitNodes is set. Bugfix on 0.2.2.7-alpha.</li>\n<li>When the set of permitted nodes changes, we now remove any mappings<br />\n      introduced via TrackExitHosts to now-excluded nodes. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>We never cannibalize a circuit that had excluded nodes on it, even<br />\n      if StrictNodes is 0. Bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>Revert a change where we would be laxer about attaching streams to<br />\n      circuits than when building the circuits. This was meant to prevent<br />\n      a set of bugs where streams were never attachable, but our improved<br />\n      code here should make this unnecessary. Bugfix on 0.2.2.7-alpha.</li>\n<li>Keep track of how many times we launch a new circuit to handle a<br />\n      given stream. Too many launches could indicate an inconsistency<br />\n      between our \"launch a circuit to handle this stream\" logic and our<br />\n      \"attach this stream to one of the available circuits\" logic.</li>\n<li>Improve log messages related to excluded nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a spurious warning when moving from a short month to a long<br />\n      month on relays with month-based BandwidthAccounting. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.2.17-alpha; fixes bug 3020.</li>\n<li>When a client finds that an origin circuit has run out of 16-bit<br />\n      stream IDs, we now mark it as unusable for new streams. Previously,<br />\n      we would try to close the entire circuit. Bugfix on 0.0.6.</li>\n<li>Add a forgotten cast that caused a compile warning on OS X 10.6.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.2.24-alpha.</li>\n<li>Be more careful about reporting the correct error from a failed<br />\n      connect() system call. Under some circumstances, it was possible to<br />\n      look at an incorrect value for errno when sending the end reason.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>Correctly handle an \"impossible\" overflow cases in connection byte<br />\n      counting, where we write or read more than 4GB on an edge connection<br />\n      in a single second. Bugfix on 0.1.2.8-beta.</li>\n<li>Correct the warning displayed when a rendezvous descriptor exceeds<br />\n      the maximum size. Fixes bug 2750; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha. Found by<br />\n      John Brooks.</li>\n<li>Clients and hidden services now use HSDir-flagged relays for hidden<br />\n      service descriptor downloads and uploads even if the relays have no<br />\n      DirPort set and the client has disabled TunnelDirConns. This will<br />\n      eventually allow us to give the HSDir flag to relays with no<br />\n      DirPort. Fixes bug 2722; bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>\n<li>Downgrade \"no current certificates known for authority\" message from<br />\n      Notice to Info. Fixes bug 2899; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>\n<li>Make the SIGNAL DUMP control-port command work on FreeBSD. Fixes bug<br />\n      2917. Bugfix on 0.1.1.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Only limit the lengths of single HS descriptors, even when multiple<br />\n      HS descriptors are published to an HSDir relay in a single POST<br />\n      operation. Fixes bug 2948; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha. Found by hsdir.</li>\n<li>Write the current time into the LastWritten line in our state file,<br />\n      rather than the time from the previous write attempt. Also, stop<br />\n      trying to use a time of -1 in our log statements. Fixes bug 3039;<br />\n      bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha.</li>\n<li>Be more consistent in our treatment of file system paths. \"~\" should<br />\n      get expanded to the user's home directory in the Log config option.<br />\n      Fixes bug 2971; bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha, which introduced the<br />\n      feature for the -f and --DataDirectory options.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure every relay writes a state file at least every 12 hours.<br />\n      Previously, a relay could go for weeks without writing its state<br />\n      file, and on a crash could lose its bandwidth history, capacity<br />\n      estimates, client country statistics, and so on. Addresses bug 3012.</li>\n<li>Send END_STREAM_REASON_NOROUTE in response to EHOSTUNREACH errors.<br />\n      Clients before 0.2.1.27 didn't handle NOROUTE correctly, but such<br />\n      clients are already deprecated because of security bugs.</li>\n<li>Don't allow v0 hidden service authorities to act as clients.<br />\n      Required by fix for bug 3000.</li>\n<li>Ignore SIGNAL NEWNYM commands on relay-only Tor instances. Required<br />\n      by fix for bug 3000.</li>\n<li>Ensure that no empty [dirreq-](read|write)-history lines are added<br />\n      to an extrainfo document. Implements ticket 2497.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Code simplification and refactoring:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove workaround code to handle directory responses from servers<br />\n      that had bug 539 (they would send HTTP status 503 responses _and_<br />\n      send a body too). Since only server versions before<br />\n      0.2.0.16-alpha/0.1.2.19 were affected, there is no longer reason to<br />\n      keep the workaround in place.</li>\n<li>Remove the old 'fuzzy time' logic. It was supposed to be used for<br />\n      handling calculations where we have a known amount of clock skew and<br />\n      an allowed amount of unknown skew. But we only used it in three<br />\n      places, and we never adjusted the known/unknown skew values. This is<br />\n      still something we might want to do someday, but if we do, we'll<br />\n      want to do it differently.</li>\n<li>Avoid signed/unsigned comparisons by making SIZE_T_CEILING unsigned.<br />\n      None of the cases where we did this before were wrong, but by making<br />\n      this change we avoid warnings. Fixes bug 2475; bugfix on 0.2.1.28.</li>\n<li>Use GetTempDir to find the proper temporary directory location on<br />\n      Windows when generating temporary files for the unit tests. Patch by<br />\n      Gisle Vanem.</li>\n</ul>"

    "content": "<p>We need more bridges. When I first envisioned the bridge address arms race, I said \"We need to get lots of bridges, so the adversary can't learn them all.\" That was the wrong statement to make. In retrospect, the correct statement was: \"We need the rate of new bridge addresses to exceed the rate that the adversary can block them.\"</p>\n<p>For background, <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/bridges\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridge relays</a> (aka bridges) are Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor directory. So even if an attacker blocks all the public relays, they still need to block all these \"private\" or \"dark\" relays too. We deployed them <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/blocking.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">several years ago</a> in anticipation of the upcoming arms race, and <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/picturing-tor-censorship-china\" rel=\"nofollow\">they worked great in their first showing in 2009</a>. But since then, China has <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=bridge-users&amp;start=2010-01-01&amp;end=2011-04-09&amp;country=cn#bridge-users\" rel=\"nofollow\">learned and blocked</a> most of the bridges we give out through public (https and gmail) distribution channels.</p>\n<p>One piece of the puzzle is <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bridge-distribution-strategies\" rel=\"nofollow\">smarter bridge distribution mechanisms</a> (plus see <a href=\"http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Dec-2009/msg00000.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this post</a> for more thoughts) &mdash; right now we're getting 8000 mails a day from gmail asking for bridges from a pool of <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html#networksize\" rel=\"nofollow\">less than a thousand</a>. The distribution strategy that works best right now is ad hoc distribution via social connections. But even if we come up with brilliant new distribution mechanisms, we simply need more addresses to work with. How can we get them? Here are five strategies.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach one:</strong> Make it easy to become a bridge using the Vidalia interface. This approach was our first try at getting more bridges: click on \"Sharing\", then \"Help censored users reach the Tor network\". Easy to do, and lots of people have done it. But lots here is thousands, not hundreds of thousands. Nobody knows that they should click it or why.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach two:</strong> Bridge-by-default bundles. People who want to help out can now simply download and run our <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/windows-bridge-default-bundle\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridge-by-default</a> bundle, and poof they're a bridge. There's a lot of flexibility here. For example, we could provide a customized bridge-by-default bundle for a Chinese human rights NGO that publishes your bridge address directly to them; then they give out the bridge addresses from their volunteers through their own social network. I think this strategy will be most effective when combined with targeted advocacy, that is, after a given community is convinced that they want to help and want to know how they can best help.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach three:</strong> Fast, stable, reachable Tor clients auto-promote themselves. Tor clients can monitor their own stability, performance, and reachability, and the best clients can opt to become bridges automatically. We can tune the thresholds (\"how fast, how stable\") in the directory consensus, to tailor how many clients promote themselves in response to demand. Read <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/175-automatic-node-promotion.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">the proposal</a> for more details. In theory this approach could provide us with many tens of thousands of bridges in a wide array of locations &mdash; and we're drawing from a pool of people who already have other reasons to download Tor. Downsides include a) there's quite a bit of coding work remaining before we can launch it, b) there are certainly situations where we shouldn't turn a Tor user into a bridge, which means we need to sort out some smart way to interact with the user and get permission, and c) these users don't actually change addresses as often as we might want, so we're still in the \"gets lots of bridges\" mindset rather than the \"increase the rate of new bridge addresses\" mindset.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach four:</strong> Redirect entire address blocks into the Tor network. There's no reason the bridge and its address need to run in the same location, and it's really addresses that are the critical resource here. If we get our friends at various ISPs to redirect some spare /16 networks our way, we'd have a lot more addresses to play with, and more importantly, we can control the churn of these addresses. Past experience with some censors shows that they work hard to unblock addresses that are no longer acting as proxies. If we light up only a tiny fraction of the IP space at a time, how long until they block all of it? How much does the presence of other services on the address block make them hesitate? I want to find out. The end game here is for Comcast to give us a few random IP addresses from each of their /24 networks. All the code on the Tor bridge side already works here, so the next steps are a) figure out how to teach an ISP's router to redirect some of its address space to us, and then b) sign up some people who have a good social network of users who need bridges, and get them to play that arms race more actively.</p>\n<p><strong>Approach five:</strong> More generic proxies. Originally I had thought that the extra layer of encryption and authentication from a bridge was a crucial piece of keeping the user (call her Alice) safe. But I'm increasingly thinking that the security properties she gets from a Tor circuit (anonymity/privacy) can be separated from the security properties she gets from the bridge (reachability, and optionally obfuscation). That is, as long as Alice can fetch the <a href=\"https://torproject.org/docs/faq#KeyManagement\" rel=\"nofollow\">signed Tor network consensus</a> and verify the keys of each of the public relays in her path, it doesn't matter so much that the bridge gets to see her traffic. Attacks by the bridge are no more effective than attacks by a local network adversary, which by design is not much. Now, this conclusion is premature &mdash; adding a bridge into the picture means there's a new observation point in addition to the local network adversary, and observation points are exactly what the attacker needs to correlate traffic flows and break Tor's anonymity, But on the flip side, right now bridges already get to act as these observational points, and the extra layer of encryption they add doesn't seem to help Alice any. So it's <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2764\" rel=\"nofollow\">too early to say</a> that a socks or https proxy is just as safe as a bridge (assuming you use a full Tor circuit in either case), but I'm optimistic that these more generic proxies have a role to play.</p>\n<p>If we go this route, then rather than needing volunteers to run a whole Tor (which is especially cumbersome because it needs libraries like OpenSSL), people could run socks proxies on a much broader set of platforms. For example, they should be easy to add into <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/android\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orbot</a> (our Tor package for Android) or into <a href=\"https://seattle.cs.washington.edu/html/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Seattle</a> (an overlay network by UW researchers that restricts applications to a safe subset of Python). We could even imagine setting up a website where volunteers visit a given page and it runs a Flash or Java applet socks proxy, lending their address to the bridge pool while their browser is open. There are some gotchas to work through, such as a) needing to sign the applets so they have the required network permissions, b) figuring out how to get around the fact that it seems hard to allow connections from the Internet to a flash plugin, and c) needing to program the socks proxy with a Tor bridge or relay address so the user doesn't have to ask for it (after all, socks handshakes are unencrypted and it wouldn't do to let the adversary watch Alice ask for an IP address that's known to be associated with Tor). This 'flash proxy' idea was developed in collaboration with Dan Boneh at Stanford, and they are currently designing and building it &mdash; stay tuned.</p>"

    "content": "<p>I spent two days in Iceland discussing Tor and freedom of information with various people.  I talked to a few people, including a member of Icelandic Parliament, about the International Modern Media Institute, <a href=\"http://immi.is/\" title=\"http://immi.is/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://immi.is/</a>.  The goals of IMMI are to secure free speech and defining new operating principles for the global media.  They are starting with Iceland and moving on to the world.  They already have much success in Iceland, but are running into issues of scale and funding.  They could use some help.</p>\n<p>The second day I talked to the computer forensics team from the National Police of Iceland about Tor, <a href=\"http://www.logreglan.is/\" title=\"http://www.logreglan.is/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.logreglan.is/</a>.  We discussed all things Tor and their experiences with it.  Apparently there are 'computer specialists' traveling Europe talking to law enforcement (for great profit) disparaging any technology that provides security and privacy to citizens as 'for child abuse and organized crime'.  These people neglect to mention that all technologies are dual usage and the human behind it determines the good or bad usage of the technology.  One of the officers mentions that no one talks about crowbar crime, but everyone is talking about computer crime as if humans aren't involved.  Overall, it was a great discussion lasting a few hours.</p>\n<p>I then head over to work with the people from 1984, <a href=\"https://1984.is/\" title=\"https://1984.is/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://1984.is/</a>.  They are one of the largest hosting providers in Iceland.  And thanks to them, we now have <a href=\"http://torproject.is\" title=\"http://torproject.is\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://torproject.is</a> hosted in the country.  I learned more about the physical infrastructure of the Internet in Iceland.  We discussed ways to increase competition now that the Iceland Govt bailed out the company that owns nearly all of the fiber in the country.  Imagine a country with fiber everywhere (already true in Iceland) and treating it like the road infrastructure with any provider getting access to it.  Now mix in successful freedom of expression laws from IMMI.</p>\n<p>That night I talked about Tor to the only hackerspace in Iceland at their beer and crypto night at Hakkavélin, <a href=\"http://hakkavelin.is/\" title=\"http://hakkavelin.is/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hakkavelin.is/</a>.  Someone showed up and recorded my entire talk until their battery ran out.  kapteinnkrokur posted the video at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOayRK48vdE\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOayRK48vdE\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOayRK48vdE</a>.  I covered Tor topics, life under surveillance, and some more advanced topics relating to bridges, ssl filtering, and attempted DHT directory info over Tor.  Afterwards, many went out to a bar to talk more until 2 AM.  I had a great chat with Bjarni and Ewelina from PageKite, <a href=\"https://pagekite.net/\" title=\"https://pagekite.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://pagekite.net/</a>, about Tor marketing, supporting privacy enhancing technology, and peer to peer collaboration for all.  </p>\n<p>Iceland is a fantastic country and the people are great.  I hope to spend more time there, as soon as the volcanoes stop disrupting flights.  </p>\n<p>Thank you to Björgvin, Birgitta,  Berglind, and  Mörður for arranging meetings and hosting me for the two days.</p>"

Bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 3198 (suggested by 2355).</p>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>\n<li>Require that onion keys have exponent 65537 in microdescriptors too.<br />\n      Fixes more of bug 3207; bugfix on 0.2.2.26-beta.</p>\n<li>Tor used to limit HttpProxyAuthenticator values to 48 characters.<br />\n      Changed the limit to 512 characters by removing base64 newlines.<br />\n      Fixes bug 2752. Fix by Michael Yakubovich.</p>\n<li>When a client starts or stops using bridges, never use a circuit<br />\n      that was built before the configuration change. This behavior could<br />\n      put at risk a user who uses bridges to ensure that her traffic<br />\n      only goes to the chosen addresses. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes<br />\n      bug 3200.</p>\n<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.2.26-beta - 2011-05-17</strong><br />\n  Tor 0.2.2.26-beta fixes a variety of potential privacy problems. It<br />\n  also introduces a new \"socksport auto\" approach that should make it<br />\n  easier to run multiple Tors on the same system, and does a lot of<br />\n  cleanup to get us closer to a release candidate.</p>\n<p><strong>Security/privacy fixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace all potentially sensitive memory comparison operations<br />\n      with versions whose runtime does not depend on the data being<br />\n      compared. This will help resist a class of attacks where an<br />\n      adversary can use variations in timing information to learn<br />\n      sensitive data. Fix for one case of bug 3122. (Safe memcmp<br />\n      implementation by Robert Ransom based partially on code by DJB.)</li>\n<li>When receiving a hidden service descriptor, check that it is for<br />\n      the hidden service we wanted. Previously, Tor would store any<br />\n      hidden service descriptors that a directory gave it, whether it<br />\n      wanted them or not. This wouldn't have let an attacker impersonate<br />\n      a hidden service, but it did let directories pre-seed a client<br />\n      with descriptors that it didn't want. Bugfix on 0.0.6.</li>\n<li>On SIGHUP, do not clear out all TrackHostExits mappings, client<br />\n      DNS cache entries, and virtual address mappings: that's what<br />\n      NEWNYM is for. Fixes bug 1345; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The options SocksPort, ControlPort, and so on now all accept a<br />\n      value \"auto\" that opens a socket on an OS-selected port. A<br />\n      new ControlPortWriteToFile option tells Tor to write its<br />\n      actual control port or ports to a chosen file. If the option<br />\n      ControlPortFileGroupReadable is set, the file is created as<br />\n      group-readable. Now users can run two Tor clients on the same<br />\n      system without needing to manually mess with parameters. Resolves<br />\n      part of ticket 3076.</li>\n<li>Set SO_REUSEADDR on all sockets, not just listeners. This should<br />\n      help busy exit nodes avoid running out of useable ports just<br />\n      because all the ports have been used in the near past. Resolves<br />\n      issue 2850.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>New \"GETINFO net/listeners/(type)\" controller command to return<br />\n      a list of addresses and ports that are bound for listeners for a<br />\n      given connection type. This is useful when the user has configured<br />\n      \"SocksPort auto\" and the controller needs to know which port got<br />\n      chosen. Resolves another part of ticket 3076.</li>\n<li>Add a new ControlSocketsGroupWritable configuration option: when<br />\n      it is turned on, ControlSockets are group-writeable by the default<br />\n      group of the current user. Patch by Jérémy Bobbio; implements<br />\n      ticket 2972.</li>\n<li>Tor now refuses to create a ControlSocket in a directory that is<br />\n      world-readable (or group-readable if ControlSocketsGroupWritable<br />\n      is 0). This is necessary because some operating systems do not<br />\n      enforce permissions on an AF_UNIX sockets. Permissions on the<br />\n      directory holding the socket, however, seems to work everywhere.</li>\n<li>Rate-limit a warning about failures to download v2 networkstatus<br />\n      documents. Resolves part of bug 1352.</li>\n<li>Backport code from 0.2.3.x that allows directory authorities to<br />\n      clean their microdescriptor caches. Needed to resolve bug 2230.</li>\n<li>When an HTTPS proxy reports \"403 Forbidden\", we now explain<br />\n      what it means rather than calling it an unexpected status code.<br />\n      Closes bug 2503. Patch from Michael Yakubovich.</li>\n<li>Update to the May 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Authorities now clean their microdesc cache periodically and when<br />\n      reading from disk initially, not only when adding new descriptors.<br />\n      This prevents a bug where we could lose microdescriptors. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.2.6-alpha. 2230</li>\n<li>Do not crash when our configuration file becomes unreadable, for<br />\n      example due to a permissions change, between when we start up<br />\n      and when a controller calls SAVECONF. Fixes bug 3135; bugfix<br />\n      on 0.0.9pre6.</li>\n<li>Avoid a bug that would keep us from replacing a microdescriptor<br />\n      cache on Windows. (We would try to replace the file while still<br />\n      holding it open. That's fine on Unix, but Windows doesn't let us<br />\n      do that.) Bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha; bug found by wanoskarnet.</li>\n<li>Add missing explanations for the authority-related torrc options<br />\n      RephistTrackTime, BridgePassword, and V3AuthUseLegacyKey in the<br />\n      man page. Resolves issue 2379.</li>\n<li>As an authority, do not upload our own vote or signature set to<br />\n      ourself. It would tell us nothing new, and as of 0.2.2.24-alpha,<br />\n      it would get flagged as a duplicate. Resolves bug 3026.</li>\n<li>Accept hidden service descriptors if we think we might be a hidden<br />\n      service directory, regardless of what our consensus says. This<br />\n      helps robustness, since clients and hidden services can sometimes<br />\n      have a more up-to-date view of the network consensus than we do,<br />\n      and if they think that the directory authorities list us a HSDir,<br />\n      we might actually be one. Related to bug 2732; bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>\n<li>When a controller changes TrackHostExits, remove mappings for<br />\n      hosts that should no longer have their exits tracked. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>When a controller changes VirtualAddrNetwork, remove any mappings<br />\n      for hosts that were automapped to the old network. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.1.19-rc.</li>\n<li>When a controller changes one of the AutomapHosts* options, remove<br />\n      any mappings for hosts that should no longer be automapped. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Do not reset the bridge descriptor download status every time we<br />\n      re-parse our configuration or get a configuration change. Fixes<br />\n      bug 3019; bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (code cleanup):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When loading the microdesc journal, remember its current size.<br />\n      In 0.2.2, this helps prevent the microdesc journal from growing<br />\n      without limit on authorities (who are the only ones to use it in<br />\n      0.2.2). Fixes a part of bug 2230; bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha.<br />\n      Fix posted by \"cypherpunks.\"</li>\n<li>The microdesc journal is supposed to get rebuilt only if it is<br />\n      at least _half_ the length of the store, not _twice_ the length<br />\n      of the store. Bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha; fixes part of bug 2230.</li>\n<li>Fix a potential null-pointer dereference while computing a<br />\n      consensus. Bugfix on tor-0.2.0.3-alpha, found with the help of<br />\n      clang's analyzer.</li>\n<li>Avoid a possible null-pointer dereference when rebuilding the mdesc<br />\n      cache without actually having any descriptors to cache. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.2.6-alpha. Issue discovered using clang's static analyzer.</li>\n<li>If we fail to compute the identity digest of a v3 legacy keypair,<br />\n      warn, and don't use a buffer-full of junk instead. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.1.1-alpha; fixes bug 3106.</li>\n<li>Resolve an untriggerable issue in smartlist_string_num_isin(),<br />\n      where if the function had ever in the future been used to check<br />\n      for the presence of a too-large number, it would have given an<br />\n      incorrect result. (Fortunately, we only used it for 16-bit<br />\n      values.) Fixes bug 3175; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>Require that introduction point keys and onion handshake keys<br />\n      have a public exponent of 65537. Starts to fix bug 3207; bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Removed features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Caches no longer download and serve v2 networkstatus documents<br />\n      unless FetchV2Networkstatus flag is set: these documents haven't<br />\n      haven't been used by clients or relays since 0.2.0.x.

While ultimately it should be handled identically to the referer, that was not clear in the original text.<br />\n<b>Updated 07/01/2011</b>: Add link to article about 81% consumer polling rate in favor of some form of Do Not Track...<br />\n<br></p>\n<p>As I said in my <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/toggle-or-not-toggle-end-torbutton\">previous post</a>, the Tor Project hopes to work on <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2871\">a set of patches</a> that effectively improves the Private Browsing Mode of Firefox. Long term, we'd love to merge these patches upstream, and/or see them obsoleted by better implementations.</p>\n<p>To help keep everyone on the same page with respect to this effort, I've decided to take some time to describe what we envision as our ideal private browsing mode.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, such a mode would be useful for more than just Tor users. Indeed, there are many ways to obtain varying levels of IP address privacy once you have solid browser support for privacy by design. The average user is quite capable of going to a cafe and enabling private mode, and this ability can be explained to them in a single sentence by the UI. Arguably they can also obtain low-grade IP privacy simply by tethering to their cell phone, whose IP typically changes regularly. I am told that frequent IP rotation is also the norm for residential connections in Germany and much of the EU to deter services and malware. This is not to mention all of the commercial single-hop VPN and proxy privacy services out there that fail to provide actual browser privacy in their tools.</p>\n<p>We believe that the <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/168871-survey-shows-consumers-want-government-to-protect-their-privacy-online\">attention surrounding the \"Do-Not-Track\" header</a> also indicates that network privacy is an important feature. However, we believe that it must be provided by design, as opposed to via a humble request to the adversary that is impossible to audit or enforce, especially outside of the United States. In his <a href=\"http://w2spconf.com/2011/papers/balaSlides.pdf\">presentation</a> at <a href=\"http://w2spconf.com/2011/\">W2SP</a>, <a href=\"http://www.research.att.com/~bala/papers/\">Balachander Krishnamurthy</a> compared the \"Do-Not-Track\" request header to the real-world equivalent of leaving your door unlocked with a posted notice that reads \"Do-Not-Rob\". While many people actually do post \"No Trespassing\" and similar signs, no one expects these signs to replace actual security measures.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, right now the only usable and effective web privacy option for the average user is to install an <a href=\"http://adblockplus.org/\">ad-blocker</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ghostery.com/\">similar software</a>. Personally, I see the need for an ad-blocker to achieve privacy as a huge failure of the web itself. If web tracking, profiling, and behavioral targeting is so extreme that it cannot be avoided except by blocking all ads, then the prevailing revenue model of the web is unsustainable. We must figure out a way to do non-intrusive, content-relevant advertising while still providing privacy, without relying on regulatory action that is unlikely to be enforceable.</p>\n<p>Ok, so enough preaching. What does privacy by design look like? I'm going to describe a list of 7 key properties, some of which the major browser vendors already have or are working towards, but so far are not uniformly deployed in any browser, including even our own Tor Browser. </p>\n<ol style=\"padding: 0 0 0 30px;\">\n<li><b>Make local privacy optional</b></li>\n<li><b>Avoid Linkability: Minimize privacy options, plugins and addons</b></li>\n<li><b>Avoid Linkability: Isolate all non-private mode identifiers and state</b></li>\n<li><b>Avoid Linkability: Isolate state per top-level domain</b></li>\n<li><b>Avoid Linkability: Reduce fingerprintable attributes</b></li>\n<li><b>Avoid Linkability: Reduce default referer information</b></li>\n<li><b>Avoid Linkability: Restrict window.name to referer policy</b></li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/></p>\n<h1>Make local privacy optional</h1>\n<p>The browser vendors got it half right the first time around. There are many users who consider local storage privacy to be the primary feature they want from private browsing mode. However, we believe that local privacy is actually an orthogonal feature to network privacy: some users want both, but some only want one or the other.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we believe that users should be given the option in private browsing mode to choose if they want to record browsing history or not. Many users will want to use private mode regularly, and will only be concerned about ad network tracking as opposed to local storage (ie similar to the \"Do-Not-Track\" header's use case). These users will still want history and \"awesome bar\" functionality to work for them. Almost all users will want to maintain access to their bookmarks and previously stored history from within the mode.</p>\n<h1>Avoid Linkability: Minimize privacy options, plugins, and addons</h1>\n<p>Beyond the choice to store history and activity on disk, there <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3100\">should not be</a> numerous global options provided to private browsing modes. </p>\n<p>Each option that detectably alters browser behavior can be used as a fingerprinting tool on the part of ad networks. Similarly, <a href=\"http://blog.chromium.org/2010/06/extensions-in-incognito.html\">all extensions should be disabled in the mode except as an opt-in basis</a>.</p>\n<p>Instead of global browser privacy options, <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Privacy/Features/Site-based_data_management_UI\">privacy decisions should be made per top-level url-bar domain</a> to eliminate the possibility of linkability between domains. For example, when a plugin object (or a JavaScript  access of window.plugins) is present in a page, the user should be given the choice of allowing that plugin object <b>for that top-level url-bar domain only</b>. The same goes for exemptions to third party cookie policy, geo-location, and any other privacy permissions.</p>\n<p>If the user has indicated they do not care about local history storage, these permissions can be written to disk. Otherwise, they should remain memory-only. </p>\n<h1>Avoid Linkability: Isolate all non-private identifiers and state</h1>\n<p>All major browsers already make some effort to isolate explicit identifier state between non-private and private browsing (despite protest that their threat model does not actually require it). Obviously, privacy by design requires that this effort be continued.</p>\n<p>The ability to link users between private and non-private browsing modes via explicit identifiers, browser state, or TLS state should be considered a flaw in the mode. After all, the user may have gone to a wifi cafe to obtain IP address privacy, expecting identifier privacy from their browser. It is not fair to <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anonymous_Browsing#Use_Cases\">the user</a> to abjectly fail to protect them in this case.</p>\n<h1>Avoid Linkability: Isolate state to top-level domain</h1>\n<p>However, users who want continuous \"Do-Not-Track\"-style privacy will likely use the mode regularly, possibly even exclusively, to avoid behavior advertising and associated tracking. <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anonymous_Browsing#The_Paranoid\">These users</a> will also want to reduce the linkability between arbitrary sites they visit.</p>\n<p>This is a particular concern for Tor as many activists use web-based email, social networking sites, and other web services for organizing. Their activity in Tor Browser on one site should not trivially de-anonymize their activity on another site to ad networks and exits.</p>\n<p>To provide this property, all identifiers and state must be isolated to the top-level url bar domain, <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thirdparty\">starting with cookies</a>, but extending to <a href=\"http://www.safecache.com/\">the cache</a>, DOM Storage, client certificates, and HTTP auth.</p>\n<p>The benefit of this approach comes not only in the form of reduced linkability, but also in terms of simplified privacy UI. If all stored browser state and permissions become associated with the top-level url-bar domain, the six or seven different pieces of privacy UI governing these identifiers and permissions can become just <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=565965#c21\">one piece of UI</a>, possibly with a context-menu option to drill down into specific types of state.</p>\n<p>We also believe that such an identifier model makes privacy relationships much more clear to the average user. Instead of having various disjoint relationships with and permissions for hundreds of omnipresent third-party domains, users will have one relationship with each of the top-level url-bar domains that they choose to interact with and authenticate to.</p>\n<p>Obviously, the downside of this enhanced protection against identifier linkability is that third party services that rely on third party cookie transmission may be impeded by this model. Long term, the hope is for standardized, in-browser support for services federated login and \"Like\" buttons. Google Chrome has actually implemented a feature called <a href=\"http://web-send.org/\">Web-Send</a> that provides this functionality in a <a href=\"http://web-send.org/features.html\">privacy preserving way</a>. They have even written a legacy HTML5 version that provides the same privacy properties, save for the need to trust <a href=\"http://webintroducer.net\" title=\"http://webintroducer.net\">http://webintroducer.net</a> for DOM Storage.</p>\n<p>We are also trying to introduce the notion of \"protected cookies\" in the alpha Tor Browser series, to allow users to specify they want to maintain a relationship with certain sites but not with others. To simplify this experience, we've currently entirely disabled Third Party Cookies in Tor Browser, but we believe that this may end up breaking mashup and federated login sites that might still be able to function under the more lenient double-keyed cookie model.</p>\n<p>Several other interim steps are possible in the meantime. One could imagine iframe attributes that cause the browser chrome to request that a site be granted permission to set top-level cookies, or even a fully automated client-side mechanism that performs this promotion automatically for selected sites on mouse-click (such a mechanism is actually being prototyped by researchers right now).</p>\n<h1>Avoid Linkability: Reduce fingerprintable attributes</h1>\n<p>Once the linkability via explicit identifiers is eliminated, it becomes important to address the linkability that is possible through <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Fingerprinting\">browser fingerprinting</a>.</p>\n<p>Fingerprinting is a difficult issue to address, but that difficulty does not preclude a best-effort from being made at eliminating or mitigating the major culprits.</p>\n<p>Luckily, <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Fingerprinting#Data\">the major culprit</a> is plugin-provided information. Once plugins are restricted to only permitted top-level domains, fingerprinting linkability gets effectively reduced to the information available via CSS, Javascript, and HTTP headers.</p>\n<p>The largest culprits in CSS and Javascript are <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2875\">resolution and media information</a> (especially those properties that also provide information about the device and display as opposed to limiting information to the properties of the rendering window itself), the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2872\">number of fonts that can be loaded per origin</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3059\">time-based fingerprints</a>, and <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3323\">WebGL device information</a>.</p>\n<p>It is likely that we need another Panopticlick-style study that focuses exclusively on CSS and Javascript to determine the relative importance of these components, but most of them can be addressed without serious breakage of functionality.</p>\n<h1>Avoid Linkability: Reduce default referer information</h1>\n<p>So far, the Tor Project has refrained from restricting referer primarily because we believe that restricting referer actually becomes less necessary if identifiers are isolated and linkability has been reduced.</p>\n<p>However, non-Tor users do have one important element of linkability: IP address. Even those that have an alternate Internet connection may still be bound to a single alternate IP. These users probably actually benefit in a real way from a restricted referer. It turns out a lot of <a href=\"http://w2spconf.com/2011/papers/privacyVsProtection.pdf\">information is already smuggled or leaked via referrer</a> and URL parameters to third party sites, either deliberately or accidentally.</p>\n<p>Referer restriction could take multiple forms, but we believe more site flexibility is key. Sites actually have no way to restrict referer for most element types currently, and conversely, sites will always be able to subvert referer restrictions by smuggling the same data in POST or URL parameters.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we believe that referers should be restricted by default in private browsing mode using a same-origin policy where sites from different origins get either no referer, or a referer that is truncated to the top-level domain. However, sites should also be allowed to request an exemption to this rule on a per-site basis using an html attribute, which could trigger a chrome permissions request, or simply be granted automatically (on the assumption that they could just URL smuggle the data).</p>\n<p>While this may not seem like much of a protection, at least it allows us to differentiate negligence from deliberate information sharing, and to restrict information leakage in the default scenario. Again, because this data can always be transmitted between elements either directly or via a back-channel, it is better it be visible and apparent than covert.</p>\n<h1>Avoid Linkability: Restrict window.name to referer policy</h1>\n<p>Window.name poses many of the same conflicts as referer information. It gives sites a way to pass data between pages in the navigation lifespan of a tab. Sites can <a href=\"http://www.thomasfrank.se/sessionvars.html\">use window.name to store data</a>, but are given no way to clear it easily. Hence it becomes very hard to differentiate deliberate data exchange from accidental leakage.</p>\n<p>Just like referer, it is obvious that window.name should be empty whenever the URL bar is rewritten by the user. There should be no legitimate, functional need for data exchange between two arbitrary random user-typed URL bar domains in any situation. Window.name on user-entered URLs should be cleared regardless of any changes to existing referer policy.</p>\n<p>Similarly, sites could be given the option to allow transmission of window.name to third party iframe elements, but the default should be to isolate window.name to the same origin policy. We do not believe this second step is required for Tor usage, but it may be helpful to non-Tor users, for similar reasons as the referer leakage.</p>\n<p>As such, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3414\">our current plan</a> is to bind window.name's lifespan to the Referer header contents in our addon implementations.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>We believe that privacy can be a differentiating feature for browsers.  Even <a href=\"http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/abstracts/privatebrowsing.html\">early studies</a> revealed that many users immediately began using private browsing modes regularly, either by mistake or deliberately.</p>\n<p>We believe that <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anonymous_Browsing#Use_Cases\">many of these users</a> deliberately use private browsing in cafes and on other alternate Internet connections assuming that they are being protected from ad tracking and behavioral analysis. We welcome user studies to determine what users actually expect and want from private browsing modes for the definitive answer, but obviously we're pretty convinced what the outcome will be.</p>\n<p>Privacy by design represents the technical realization of \"Do-Not-Track\": the ability to actually opt-out (prevent) a complete behavior profile from being built to record and model your specific web viewing habits.</p>\n<p>In order for a private browsing mode to succeed in actually providing privacy by design, it must reduce activity linkability in all forms. Six out of the seven items mentioned above are really linkability issues at their core. Reducing the ability of the adversary to link private activity to non-private activity and also to other private activity is what privacy by design is all about. This reduction in linkability is what prevents a behavioral profile from being constructed.</p>\n<p>The Tor Project looks forward to a day where privacy by design becomes a key feature of major browsers. We would love to be able to ship a vastly simplified browser extension that contains only a compiled Tor binary and some minimal addon code that simply \"upgrades\" the user's private browsing mode into a fully functional anonymous mode. The ability to do this would vastly simplify our package offerings, and make it significantly easier to get our software into censored and oppressed regions.</p>\n<p>However, until then, we must do our best to attempt to provide software that we believe will provide the privacy and security that users have come to expect from us. For now, this means shipping our own browser.</p>"

Its callers<br />\n      expect it to emit a CRLF iff the format string ends with CRLF;<br />\n      it actually emitted a CRLF iff (a) the format string ended with<br />\n      CRLF or (b) the resulting string was over 1023 characters long or<br />\n      (c) the format string did not end with CRLF *and* the resulting<br />\n      string was 1021 characters long or longer. Bugfix on 0.1.1.9-alpha;<br />\n      fixes part of bug 3407.</li>\n<li>Make send_control_event_impl()'s behaviour sane. Its callers<br />\n      expect it to always emit a CRLF at the end of the string; it<br />\n      might have emitted extra control characters as well. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.1.9-alpha; fixes another part of bug 3407.</li>\n<li>Make crypto_rand_int() check the value of its input correctly.<br />\n      Previously, it accepted values up to UINT_MAX, but could return a<br />\n      negative number if given a value above INT_MAX+1. Found by George<br />\n      Kadianakis. Fixes bug 3306; bugfix on 0.2.2pre14.</li>\n<li>Avoid a segfault when reading a malformed circuit build state<br />\n      with more than INT_MAX entries. Found by wanoskarnet. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.2.4-alpha.</li>\n<li>When asked about a DNS record type we don't support via a<br />\n      client DNSPort, reply with NOTIMPL rather than an empty<br />\n      reply. Patch by intrigeri. Fixes bug 3369; bugfix on 2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Fix a rare memory leak during stats writing. Found by coverity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Update to the June 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Code simplifications and refactoring:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove some dead code as indicated by coverity.</li>\n<li>Remove a few dead assignments during router parsing. Found by<br />\n      coverity.</li>\n<li>Add some forgotten return value checks during unit tests. Found<br />\n      by coverity.</li>\n<li>Don't use 1-bit wide signed bit fields. Found by coverity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.2.28-beta - 2011-06-04</strong><br />\n  Tor 0.2.2.28-beta makes great progress towards a new stable release: we<br />\n  fixed a big bug in whether relays stay in the consensus consistently,<br />\n  we moved closer to handling bridges and hidden services correctly,<br />\n  and we started the process of better handling the dreaded \"my Vidalia<br />\n  died, and now my Tor demands a password when I try to reconnect to it\"<br />\n  usability issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't decide to make a new descriptor when receiving a HUP signal.<br />\n      This bug has caused a lot of 0.2.2.x relays to disappear from the<br />\n      consensus periodically. Fixes the most common case of triggering<br />\n      bug 1810; bugfix on 0.2.2.7-alpha.</li>\n<li>Actually allow nameservers with IPv6 addresses. Fixes bug 2574.</li>\n<li>Don't try to build descriptors if \"ORPort auto\" is set and we<br />\n      don't know our actual ORPort yet. Fix for bug 3216; bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.2.26-beta.</li>\n<li>Resolve a crash that occurred when setting BridgeRelay to 1 with<br />\n      accounting enabled. Fixes bug 3228; bugfix on 0.2.2.18-alpha.</li>\n<li>Apply circuit timeouts to opened hidden-service-related circuits<br />\n      based on the correct start time. Previously, we would apply the<br />\n      circuit build timeout based on time since the circuit's creation;<br />\n      it was supposed to be applied based on time since the circuit<br />\n      entered its current state. Bugfix on 0.0.6; fixes part of bug 1297.</li>\n<li>Use the same circuit timeout for client-side introduction<br />\n      circuits as for other four-hop circuits, rather than the timeout<br />\n      for single-hop directory-fetch circuits; the shorter timeout may<br />\n      have been appropriate with the static circuit build timeout in<br />\n      0.2.1.x and earlier, but caused many hidden service access attempts<br />\n      to fail with the adaptive CBT introduced in 0.2.2.2-alpha. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.2.2-alpha; fixes another part of bug 1297.</li>\n<li>In ticket 2511 we fixed a case where you could use an unconfigured<br />\n      bridge if you had configured it as a bridge the last time you ran<br />\n      Tor. Now fix another edge case: if you had configured it as a bridge<br />\n      but then switched to a different bridge via the controller, you<br />\n      would still be willing to use the old one. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha;<br />\n      fixes bug 3321.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add an __OwningControllerProcess configuration option and a<br />\n      TAKEOWNERSHIP control-port command. Now a Tor controller can ensure<br />\n      that when it exits, Tor will shut down. Implements feature 3049.</li>\n<li>If \"UseBridges 1\" is set and no bridges are configured, Tor will<br />\n      now refuse to build any circuits until some bridges are set.<br />\n      If \"UseBridges auto\" is set, Tor will use bridges if they are<br />\n      configured and we are not running as a server, but otherwise will<br />\n      make circuits as usual. The new default is \"auto\". Patch by anonym,<br />\n      so the Tails LiveCD can stop automatically revealing you as a Tor<br />\n      user on startup.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix warnings from GCC 4.6's \"-Wunused-but-set-variable\" option.</li>\n<li>Remove a trailing asterisk from \"exit-policy/default\" in the<br />\n      output of the control port command \"GETINFO info/names\". Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.1.2.5-alpha.</li>\n<li>Use a wide type to hold sockets when built for 64-bit Windows builds.<br />\n      Fixes bug 3270.</li>\n<li>Warn when the user configures two HiddenServiceDir lines that point<br />\n      to the same directory. Bugfix on 0.0.6 (the version introducing<br />\n      HiddenServiceDir); fixes bug 3289.</li>\n<li>Remove dead code from rend_cache_lookup_v2_desc_as_dir. Fixes<br />\n      part of bug 2748; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>\n<li>Log malformed requests for rendezvous descriptors as protocol<br />\n      warnings, not warnings. Also, use a more informative log message<br />\n      in case someone sees it at log level warning without prior<br />\n      info-level messages. Fixes the other part of bug 2748; bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>\n<li>Clear the table recording the time of the last request for each<br />\n      hidden service descriptor from each HS directory on SIGNAL NEWNYM.<br />\n      Previously, we would clear our HS descriptor cache on SIGNAL<br />\n      NEWNYM, but if we had previously retrieved a descriptor (or tried<br />\n      to) from every directory responsible for it, we would refuse to<br />\n      fetch it again for up to 15 minutes. Bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha;<br />\n      fixes bug 3309.</li>\n<li>Fix a log message that said \"bits\" while displaying a value in<br />\n      bytes. Found by wanoskarnet. Fixes bug 3318; bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>When checking for 1024-bit keys, check for 1024 bits, not 128<br />\n      bytes. This allows Tor to correctly discard keys of length 1017<br />\n      through 1023. Bugfix on 0.0.9pre5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relays now log the reason for publishing a new relay descriptor,<br />\n      so we have a better chance of hunting down instances of bug 1810.<br />\n      Resolves ticket 3252.</li>\n<li>Revise most log messages that refer to nodes by nickname to<br />\n      instead use the \"$key=nickname at address\" format. This should be<br />\n      more useful, especially since nicknames are less and less likely<br />\n      to be unique. Resolves ticket 3045.</li>\n<li>Log (at info level) when purging pieces of hidden-service-client<br />\n      state because of SIGNAL NEWNYM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Removed options:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove undocumented option \"-F\" from tor-resolve: it hasn't done<br />\n      anything since 0.2.1.16-rc.</li>\n</ul>"

As a kid, many of you were bullied and harassed at school. You knew the kids picking on you at lunch, at recess, at morning before class, and after school. Further, you knew their parents, where they lived, and generally who they were outside of school. This bullying and harassment may have continued through High School, into College, and through your work life. Again, you knew their real names and far more about them than Google, Facebook, or the US Govt will ever hope to know. A real name world hasn't made life better, more civil, or safer for millions of kids growing up in it.</p>\n<p>I've spent time talking to kids that have been bullied online and in real life. It's all done with real names via Facebook, text messaging, at recess, after school, via twitter, etc.  It spreads to those trying to stop it, such as their parents who get involved to defend their kid.  These are all real name environments. Kids don't call it bullying.  It's called 'starting static' these days to skirt the word 'bullying'. Regardless of the term, it's frequently done via real names.</p>\n<p>There is a small, but growing, set of voices realizing that real name policies aren't all they are promising to provide, namely safety. <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/case-pseudonyms\" rel=\"nofollow\">EFF/Jillian York</a>, <a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2011/07/25/google-and-the-loss-of-online-anonymity/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GigOM/Matthew Ingram</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/4chan-founder-moot-anonymity-authenticity-zuc\" rel=\"nofollow\">moot</a> have all made cases why anonymity is important on the Internet. This forced dichotomy is not new, <a href=\"http://swissnet.ai.mit.edu/6095/student-papers/fall95-papers/rigby-anonymity.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karina Rigby</a> wrote about it back in 1995.</p>\n<p>We've learned over the past few years that the ability to remain anonymous has led to people instituting positive change, such as the 'Arab Spring', and to being able to research and question authority without the fear of punishment and/or death to them and their relatives in repressive regimes. Further, the option of anonymity can allow you to explore new topics, learn about new things, and join new communities. You are freed from the baggage of your own history.  People can change.</p>\n<p>Jerks can use anonymity too. Or they can use their real names. It would be an interesting study to see the abuse/complaint report numbers for Facebook, Google+, and other real name environments versus similar environments without such a real name requirement. It would be equally interesting to learn if the presence of an authority figure versus real names provides less abuse/complaints from the members.  This post is skipping the entire topic of trojan software acting in your name, such as botnets collating millions of identities to do the bidding of others.  </p>\n<p>The power is in the beholder, not the technology itself. Use your anonymity for good, while you still have it. You should be in control of your identity, not someone else.</p>"

    "content": "<p>I was invited to speak at the annual technical conference of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, <a href=\"http://nnedv.org/\" title=\"http://nnedv.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nnedv.org/</a>.  Over the past few years, I've been personally involved with helping victims and survivors of abuse. In many cases, it has been education and helping them understand what's possible on the Internet, methods to protect their privacy, and methods to control what data trails they leave behind.  I've been deeply disturbed after meeting survivors of sexual slavery, human trafficking, and child abuse. The realities of life for these people while they were being abused, and the systematic failures of the systems set up to protect and help them, is shocking. The law enforcement officers and those offering services and direct support to these victims often suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Everyone involved with the results of abuse seems to need help all around.</p>\n<p>Many people simply assume that the only answer is to disconnect and never go online again. However, often your data is online, even if you are not. Many services, friends, and access to information is increasingly available online only.  Disconnecting isn't really an option, especially if you need to find support, shelter, and services to help you.  Conversely, if you're a survivor, part of the healing process is to help others. The ability to go online anonymously and join forums, chat, or email with others in a bad place can be the difference between life and death. This is also true for those in law enforcement and support services. They need to share with people, heal and be healed. In many cases, they don't want this associated to anything a search engine, future employer, or current partners will find. They cherish their anonymity.</p>\n<p>I did two presentations, the first was loosely about cloud computing, centralized reporting, and putting your victim's and survivor's data online. The core idea was to transfer knowledge, not recommend any one product or solution. I believe people can better assess risks when they understand the data to support their decisions. This presentation is here, <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-orgranizations-privacy-you.pdf\" title=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-orgranizations-privacy-you.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-orgrani...</a>. </p>\n<p>The second presentation was more about Tor and how survivors and victims can and have used Tor in the past to regain some control of their online privacy and anonymity. This second presentation is here, <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-NNEDV-Sessions2.pdf\" title=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-NNEDV-Sessions2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2011-08-08-NNEDV-S...</a>.</p>\n<p>I'm glad NNEDV exists, and that we can help, even if in some small way, such as doing a couple of presentations.</p>"

We need your stories.</p>\n<p>We have plenty of practice explaining how Tor works, from technical specifications, design documents, academic papers, and popular presentation.  And of course, the code is all open-source.</p>\n<p>But explaining why Tor is important is more of a challenge.  We can speak in the abstract about the importance of free speech and privacy on the internet, but no abstract statement is quite so persuasive as a real-world example.</p>\n<p>We know these examples are out there.  We regularly hear from vulnerable populations and people who need to cope with surveillance. We are approached by people who need Tor to stay safe at work, whether they are going after criminals on behalf of their governments, or going after the criminals who run their governments, or just regular people trying to preserve their privacy.</p>\n<p>But naturally, most of these stories are ones that we don't have permission to share.  After all, it would hardly be in keeping with our pro-privacy beliefs to publish tech-support requests!</p>\n<p>Similarly, because we don't gather sensitive data on our network, we cannot (as some networks do) publish regular reports on what kinds of uses we are seeing. (We do not collect this data because we believe that a privacy network should put privacy foremost, and that the best way to protect people's information is not to collect it in the first place.) This is fantastic when it comes to protecting users against advertisers, censors, miscellaneous snoops, and the secret police of authoritarian regimes. But it isn't working out so well when we are asked by donors and other potential allies who want to know what supporting Tor means in less technical terms.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we work on Tor because everybody has the right to their own voice.  So while this is on the one hand a plea for information we can use to tell the world about the importance of what we're accomplishing (and try to get donations to do more of it), it's also a request born of the notion that nobody is more qualified to tell your own story than you are.</p>\n<p>So, please send us your stories so we can share them with the world. If email works, you can send it to <a href=\"mailto:tor-assistants@torproject.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">tor-assistants@torproject.org</a>, subject line \"Why I Use Tor\".  And of course, you can just post a comment here.</p>\n<p>We won't use names, but if too many details can reveal who you are, please err on the side of caution. There is no point in responding to our request if it puts you in danger. That said: why do you use Tor? Whether you use it to look at <a href=\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/03/08/the-cute-cat-theory-talk-at-etech/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cute cats</a> or political blogs, we'd like to know.  And since we designed Tor with privacy in mind, we can't know unless you tell us.</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>"

    "content": "<p>Tor's <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards\" rel=\"nofollow\">entry guard design</a> protects users in a variety of ways.</p>\n<p>First, they protect against the \"<a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#Wright:2004\" rel=\"nofollow\">predecessor attack</a>\": if you choose new relays for each circuit, eventually an attacker who runs a few relays will be your first and last hop. With entry guards, the risk of end-to-end correlation for any given circuit is the same, but the cumulative risk for all your circuits over time is capped.</p>\n<p>Second, they help to protect against the \"<a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs07-doa\" rel=\"nofollow\">denial of service as denial of anonymity</a>\" attack, where an attacker who runs quite a few relays fails any circuit that he's a part of and that he can't win against, forcing Alice (the user) to generate more circuits and thus increasing the overall chance that the attacker wins. Entry guards greatly reduce the risk, since Alice will never choose outside of a few nodes for her first hop.</p>\n<p>Third, entry guards raise the startup cost to an adversary who runs relays in order to trace users. Without entry guards, the attacker can sign up some relays and immediately start having chances to observe Alice's circuits. With them, new adversarial relays won't have the Guard flag so won't be chosen as the first hop of any circuit; and even once they earn the Guard flag, users who have already chosen guards won't switch away from their current guards for quite a while.</p>\n<p>But how long exactly? The first research question here examines vulnerability due to natural churn of entry guards. Consider an adversary who runs one entry guard with advertised capacity C. Alice maintains an ordered list of guards (chosen at random, weighted by advertised speed, from the whole list of possible guards). For each circuit, she chooses her first hop (uniformly at random) from the first G guards from her list that are currently running (appending a new guard to the list as needed, but going back to earlier guards if they reappear). How long until Alice adds the adversary's node to her guard list? You can use the uptime data from the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">directory archives</a>, either to build a model for guard churn or just to use the churn data directly. Assuming G=3, how do the results vary by C? What's the variance?</p>\n<p>Research question two: consider intentional churn due to load balancing too. Alice actually discards each guard between 30 and 60 days (uniformly chosen) after she first picks it. This intentional turnover prevents long-running guards from accumulating more and more users and getting overloaded. Another way of looking at it is that it shifts load to new guards so we can make better use of them. How much does this additional churn factor impact your answer from step one above? Or asked a different way, what fraction of Alice's vulnerability to the adversary's entry guard comes from natural churn, and what fraction from the proactive expiration? How does the answer change for different expiry intervals (e.g. between 10 and 30 days, or between 60 and 90)?</p>\n<p>Research question three: how do these answers change as we vary G? Right now we choose from among the first three guards, to reduce the variance of expected user performance -- if we always picked the first guard on the list, and some users picked a low-capacity or highly-congested relay, none of that user's circuits would perform well. That said, if choosing G=1 is a huge win for security, we should work on other ways to reduce variance.</p>\n<p>Research question four: how would these answers change if we make the cutoffs for getting the Guard flag more liberal, and/or change how we choose what nodes become guards? After all, Tor's anonymity is based on the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-measuring-safety-tor-network\" rel=\"nofollow\">diversity of entry and exit points</a>, and while it may be tough to get around exit relay scarcity, my theory is that our artificial entry point scarcity (because our requirements are overly strict) is needlessly hurting the anonymity Tor can offer.</p>\n<p>Our current algorithm for guard selection has three requirements:<br />\n1) The relay needs to have first appeared longer ago than 12.5% of the relays, or 8 days ago, whichever is shorter.<br />\n2) The relay needs to advertise at least the median bandwidth in the network, or 250KB/s, whichever is smaller.<br />\n3) The relay needs to have at least the median weighted-fractional-uptime of relays in the network, or 98% WFU, whichever is smaller. (For WFU, the clock starts ticking when we first hear about the relay; we track the percentage of that time the relay has been up, discounting values by 95% every 12 hours.)</p>\n<p>Today's guard cutoffs in practice are \"was first sighted at least 8 days ago, advertises 100KB/s of bandwidth, and has 98% WFU.\"</p>\n<p>Consider two relays, A and B. Relay A first appeared 30 days ago, disappeared for a week, and has been consistently up since then. It has a WFU (after decay, give or take a fencepost) of 786460 seconds / 824195 = 95.4%, so it's not a guard. Relay B appeared two weeks ago and has been up since then. Its WFU is 658517 / 658517 = 100%, so it gets the Guard flag -- even though it has less uptime, and even less weighted uptime.  Based on the answers to the first three research questions, which relay would serve Alice best as a guard?</p>\n<p>The big-picture tradeoff to explore is: what algorithm should we use to assign Guard flags such that a) we assign the flag to as many relays as possible, yet b) we minimize the chance that Alice will use the adversary's node as a guard?</p>"

Fixes bug 2821.\n</li>\n<li> Add the proper CA Certificates so that the \"Find Bridges\" button works<br />\n    again. Fixes bug 2835.\n  </li>\n<li> Update the useful links help page. Fixes bug 2809.\n  </li>\n<li> Reintegrate Breakpad, and make it available in platforms other than<br />\n    Windows. Resolves bug 2105.\n  </li>\n<li> Fix bandwidth assigned to relays on the Network Map. A lot of relays are<br />\n    displaying an erroneous bandwidth and since they are ordered by that<br />\n    value in the Network Map, it leads to confusion. Vidalia now specifies<br />\n    the bandwidth as the minimum of the three possible values (burst,<br />\n    average and observed). Fixes bug 2744.\n  </li>\n<li> Fix layouts in the configuration panel to make them look seamlessly<br />\n    across all platforms.\n  </li>\n<li> Add -no-remote parameter to Firefox so it allows another instance of<br />\n    non-TBB Firefox. Fixes bug 2254.\n  </li>\n<li> Add the possibility of changing the torrc path while Tor hasn't<br />\n    started. Fixes bug 3109.\n  </li>\n<li> Make the fact that bridges don't need a DirPort setting more clear by<br />\n    removing the content of the field when disabling it. Fixes bug 3119.\n  </li>\n<li> Improve command line parameter handling. Resolves bug 2965.\n  </li>\n<li> Fix layout in BandwidthGraph to display labels correctly in every<br />\n    language. Fixes bug 2500.\n  </li>\n<li> Updates README.debs to reflect the change in the packaging now that<br />\n    Vidalia uses Git. Fixes bug 3668.\n  </li>\n<li> Add a way to use the autoconfiguration for ControlPort and SocksPort.<br />\n    Tor can now autoconfigure Control and Socks Ports when the default ones<br />\n    are in use. This makes it easier to run several different instances of<br />\n    TBB at the same time. Resolves bug 3077.\n  </li>\n<li> Provide the necessary fields (Control password, ControlPort) to let<br />\n    TorButton NEWNYM.

The new TorStatus adds a new landing page, paged results that decrease latency, and carefully crafted graphs with a focus on aesthetics.  But it's not only the features that make this code so great.  We believe that many more developers will be interested in modifying and extending the codebase!

    "content": "<p>The Tor 0.2.2 release series is dedicated to the memory of Andreas<br />\nPfitzmann (1958-2010), a pioneer in anonymity and privacy research,<br />\na founder of the PETS community, a leader in our field, a mentor,<br />\nand a friend. He left us with these words: \"I had the possibility<br />\nto contribute to this world that is not as it should be. I hope I<br />\ncould help in some areas to make the world a better place, and that<br />\nI could also encourage other people to be engaged in improving the<br />\nworld. Please, stay engaged. This world needs you, your love, your<br />\ninitiative -- now I cannot be part of that anymore.\"</p>\n<p>Tor 0.2.2.32, the first stable release in the 0.2.2 branch, is finally<br />\nready. More than two years in the making, this release features improved<br />\nclient performance and hidden service reliability, better compatibility<br />\nfor Android, correct behavior for bridges that listen on more than<br />\none address, more extensible and flexible directory object handling,<br />\nbetter reporting of network statistics, improved code security, and<br />\nmany many other features and bugfixes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.torproject.org/download/download</a></p>\n<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.32 - 2011-08-27<br />\n<strong>Major features (client performance):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>When choosing which cells to relay first, relays now favor circuits<br />\n      that have been quiet recently, to provide lower latency for<br />\n      low-volume circuits. By default, relays enable or disable this<br />\n      feature based on a setting in the consensus. They can override<br />\n      this default by using the new \"CircuitPriorityHalflife\" config<br />\n      option. Design and code by Ian Goldberg, Can Tang, and Chris<br />\n      Alexander.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities now compute consensus weightings that instruct<br />\n      clients how to weight relays flagged as Guard, Exit, Guard+Exit,<br />\n      and no flag. Clients use these weightings to distribute network load<br />\n      more evenly across these different relay types. The weightings are<br />\n      in the consensus so we can change them globally in the future. Extra<br />\n      thanks to \"outofwords\" for finding some nasty security bugs in<br />\n      the first implementation of this feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major features (client performance, circuit build timeout):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Tor now tracks how long it takes to build client-side circuits<br />\n      over time, and adapts its timeout to local network performance.<br />\n      Since a circuit that takes a long time to build will also provide<br />\n      bad performance, we get significant latency improvements by<br />\n      discarding the slowest 20% of circuits. Specifically, Tor creates<br />\n      circuits more aggressively than usual until it has enough data<br />\n      points for a good timeout estimate. Implements proposal 151.</li>\n<li>Circuit build timeout constants can be controlled by consensus<br />\n      parameters. We set good defaults for these parameters based on<br />\n      experimentation on broadband and simulated high-latency links.</li>\n<li>Circuit build time learning can be disabled via consensus parameter<br />\n      or by the client via a LearnCircuitBuildTimeout config option. We<br />\n      also automatically disable circuit build time calculation if either<br />\n      AuthoritativeDirectory is set, or if we fail to write our state<br />\n      file. Implements ticket 1296.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major features (relays use their capacity better):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Set SO_REUSEADDR socket option on all sockets, not just<br />\n      listeners. This should help busy exit nodes avoid running out of<br />\n      useable ports just because all the ports have been used in the<br />\n      near past. Resolves issue 2850.</li>\n<li>Relays now save observed peak bandwidth throughput rates to their<br />\n      state file (along with total usage, which was already saved),<br />\n      so that they can determine their correct estimated bandwidth on<br />\n      restart. Resolves bug 1863, where Tor relays would reset their<br />\n      estimated bandwidth to 0 after restarting.</li>\n<li>Lower the maximum weighted-fractional-uptime cutoff to 98%. This<br />\n      should give us approximately 40-50% more Guard-flagged nodes,<br />\n      improving the anonymity the Tor network can provide and also<br />\n      decreasing the dropoff in throughput that relays experience when<br />\n      they first get the Guard flag.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities now take changes in router IP address and<br />\n      ORPort into account when determining router stability. Previously,<br />\n      if a router changed its IP or ORPort, the authorities would not<br />\n      treat it as having any downtime for the purposes of stability<br />\n      calculation, whereas clients would experience downtime since the<br />\n      change would take a while to propagate to them. Resolves issue 1035.</li>\n<li>New AccelName and AccelDir options add support for dynamic OpenSSL<br />\n      hardware crypto acceleration engines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major features (relays control their load better):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Exit relays now try harder to block exit attempts from unknown<br />\n      relays, to make it harder for people to use them as one-hop proxies<br />\n      a la tortunnel. Controlled by the refuseunknownexits consensus<br />\n      parameter (currently enabled), or you can override it on your<br />\n      relay with the RefuseUnknownExits torrc option. Resolves bug 1751;<br />\n      based on a variant of proposal 163.</li>\n<li>Add separate per-conn write limiting to go with the per-conn read<br />\n      limiting. We added a global write limit in Tor 0.1.2.5-alpha,<br />\n      but never per-conn write limits.</li>\n<li>New consensus params \"bwconnrate\" and \"bwconnburst\" to let us<br />\n      rate-limit client connections as they enter the network. It's<br />\n      controlled in the consensus so we can turn it on and off for<br />\n      experiments. It's starting out off. Based on proposal 163.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major features (controllers):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Export GeoIP information on bridge usage to controllers even if we<br />\n      have not yet been running for 24 hours. Now Vidalia bridge operators<br />\n      can get more accurate and immediate feedback about their<br />\n      contributions to the network.</li>\n<li>Add an __OwningControllerProcess configuration option and a<br />\n      TAKEOWNERSHIP control-port command. Now a Tor controller can ensure<br />\n      that when it exits, Tor will shut down. Implements feature 3049.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major features (directory authorities):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Directory authorities now create, vote on, and serve multiple<br />\n      parallel formats of directory data as part of their voting process.<br />\n      Partially implements Proposal 162: \"Publish the consensus in<br />\n      multiple flavors\".</li>\n<li>Directory authorities now agree on and publish small summaries<br />\n      of router information that clients can use in place of regular<br />\n      server descriptors. This transition will allow Tor 0.2.3 clients<br />\n      to use far less bandwidth for downloading information about the<br />\n      network. Begins the implementation of Proposal 158: \"Clients<br />\n      download consensus + microdescriptors\".</li>\n<li>The directory voting system is now extensible to use multiple hash<br />\n      algorithms for signatures and resource selection. Newer formats<br />\n      are signed with SHA256, with a possibility for moving to a better<br />\n      hash algorithm in the future.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities can now vote on arbitary integer values as<br />\n      part of the consensus process. This is designed to help set<br />\n      network-wide parameters. Implements proposal 167.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major features and bugfixes (node selection):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Revise and reconcile the meaning of the ExitNodes, EntryNodes,<br />\n      ExcludeEntryNodes, ExcludeExitNodes, ExcludeNodes, and Strict*Nodes<br />\n      options. Previously, we had been ambiguous in describing what<br />\n      counted as an \"exit\" node, and what operations exactly \"StrictNodes<br />\n      0\" would permit. This created confusion when people saw nodes built<br />\n      through unexpected circuits, and made it hard to tell real bugs from<br />\n      surprises. Now the intended behavior is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Exit\", in the context of ExitNodes and ExcludeExitNodes, means<br />\n          a node that delivers user traffic outside the Tor network.</li>\n<li>\"Entry\", in the context of EntryNodes, means a node used as the<br />\n          first hop of a multihop circuit. It doesn't include direct<br />\n          connections to directory servers.</li>\n<li>\"ExcludeNodes\" applies to all nodes.</li>\n<li>\"StrictNodes\" changes the behavior of ExcludeNodes only. When<br />\n          StrictNodes is set, Tor should avoid all nodes listed in<br />\n          ExcludeNodes, even when it will make user requests fail. When<br />\n          StrictNodes is *not* set, then Tor should follow ExcludeNodes<br />\n          whenever it can, except when it must use an excluded node to<br />\n          perform self-tests, connect to a hidden service, provide a<br />\n          hidden service, fulfill a .exit request, upload directory<br />\n          information, or fetch directory information.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>      Collectively, the changes to implement the behavior fix bug 1090.</li>\n<li>If EntryNodes, ExitNodes, ExcludeNodes, or ExcludeExitNodes<br />\n      change during a config reload, mark and discard all our origin<br />\n      circuits. This fix should address edge cases where we change the<br />\n      config options and but then choose a circuit that we created before<br />\n      the change.</li>\n<li>Make EntryNodes config option much more aggressive even when<br />\n      StrictNodes is not set. Before it would prepend your requested<br />\n      entrynodes to your list of guard nodes, but feel free to use others<br />\n      after that. Now it chooses only from your EntryNodes if any of<br />\n      those are available, and only falls back to others if a) they're<br />\n      all down and b) StrictNodes is not set.</li>\n<li>Now we refresh your entry guards from EntryNodes at each consensus<br />\n      fetch -- rather than just at startup and then they slowly rot as<br />\n      the network changes.</li>\n<li>Add support for the country code \"{??}\" in torrc options like<br />\n      ExcludeNodes, to indicate all routers of unknown country. Closes<br />\n      bug 1094.</li>\n<li>ExcludeNodes now takes precedence over EntryNodes and ExitNodes: if<br />\n      a node is listed in both, it's treated as excluded.</li>\n<li>ExcludeNodes now applies to directory nodes -- as a preference if<br />\n      StrictNodes is 0, or an absolute requirement if StrictNodes is 1.<br />\n      Don't exclude all the directory authorities and set StrictNodes to 1<br />\n      unless you really want your Tor to break.</li>\n<li>ExcludeNodes and ExcludeExitNodes now override exit enclaving.</li>\n<li>ExcludeExitNodes now overrides .exit requests.</li>\n<li>We don't use bridges listed in ExcludeNodes.</li>\n<li>When StrictNodes is 1:\n<ul>\n<li>We now apply ExcludeNodes to hidden service introduction points<br />\n         and to rendezvous points selected by hidden service users. This<br />\n         can make your hidden service less reliable: use it with caution!</li>\n<li>If we have used ExcludeNodes on ourself, do not try relay<br />\n         reachability self-tests.</li>\n<li>If we have excluded all the directory authorities, we will not<br />\n         even try to upload our descriptor if we're a relay.</li>\n<li>Do not honor .exit requests to an excluded node.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>When the set of permitted nodes changes, we now remove any mappings<br />\n      introduced via TrackExitHosts to now-excluded nodes. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>We never cannibalize a circuit that had excluded nodes on it, even<br />\n      if StrictNodes is 0. Bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>Improve log messages related to excluded nodes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major features (misc):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Numerous changes, bugfixes, and workarounds from Nathan Freitas<br />\n      to help Tor build correctly for Android phones.</li>\n<li>The options SocksPort, ControlPort, and so on now all accept a<br />\n      value \"auto\" that opens a socket on an OS-selected port. A<br />\n      new ControlPortWriteToFile option tells Tor to write its<br />\n      actual control port or ports to a chosen file. If the option<br />\n      ControlPortFileGroupReadable is set, the file is created as<br />\n      group-readable. Now users can run two Tor clients on the same<br />\n      system without needing to manually mess with parameters. Resolves<br />\n      part of ticket 3076.</li>\n<li>Tor now supports tunneling all of its outgoing connections over<br />\n      a SOCKS proxy, using the SOCKS4Proxy and/or SOCKS5Proxy<br />\n      configuration options. Code by Christopher Davis.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Code security improvements:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Replace all potentially sensitive memory comparison operations<br />\n      with versions whose runtime does not depend on the data being<br />\n      compared. This will help resist a class of attacks where an<br />\n      adversary can use variations in timing information to learn<br />\n      sensitive data. Fix for one case of bug 3122. (Safe memcmp<br />\n      implementation by Robert Ransom based partially on code by DJB.)</li>\n<li>Enable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution<br />\n      Prevention (DEP) by default on Windows to make it harder for<br />\n      attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. Patch from John Brooks.</li>\n<li>New \"--enable-gcc-hardening\" ./configure flag (off by default)<br />\n      to turn on gcc compile time hardening options. It ensures<br />\n      that signed ints have defined behavior (-fwrapv), enables<br />\n      -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 (requiring -O2), adds stack smashing protection<br />\n      with canaries (-fstack-protector-all), turns on ASLR protection if<br />\n      supported by the kernel (-fPIE, -pie), and adds additional security<br />\n      related warnings. Verified to work on Mac OS X and Debian Lenny.</li>\n<li>New \"--enable-linker-hardening\" ./configure flag (off by default)<br />\n      to turn on ELF specific hardening features (relro, now). This does<br />\n      not work with Mac OS X or any other non-ELF binary format.</li>\n<li>Always search the Windows system directory for system DLLs, and<br />\n      nowhere else. Bugfix on 0.1.1.23; fixes bug 1954.</li>\n<li>New DisableAllSwap option. If set to 1, Tor will attempt to lock all<br />\n      current and future memory pages via mlockall(). On supported<br />\n      platforms (modern Linux and probably BSD but not Windows or OS X),<br />\n      this should effectively disable any and all attempts to page out<br />\n      memory. This option requires that you start your Tor as root --<br />\n      if you use DisableAllSwap, please consider using the User option<br />\n      to properly reduce the privileges of your Tor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes (crashes):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix crash bug on platforms where gmtime and localtime can return<br />\n      NULL. Windows 7 users were running into this one. Fixes part of bug<br />\n      2077. Bugfix on all versions of Tor. Found by boboper.</li>\n<li>Introduce minimum/maximum values that clients will believe<br />\n      from the consensus. Now we'll have a better chance to avoid crashes<br />\n      or worse when a consensus param has a weird value.</li>\n<li>Fix a rare crash bug that could occur when a client was configured<br />\n      with a large number of bridges. Fixes bug 2629; bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.1.2-alpha. Bugfix by trac user \"shitlei\".</li>\n<li>Do not crash when our configuration file becomes unreadable, for<br />\n      example due to a permissions change, between when we start up<br />\n      and when a controller calls SAVECONF. Fixes bug 3135; bugfix<br />\n      on 0.0.9pre6.</li>\n<li>If we're in the pathological case where there's no exit bandwidth<br />\n      but there is non-exit bandwidth, or no guard bandwidth but there<br />\n      is non-guard bandwidth, don't crash during path selection. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>\n<li>Fix a crash bug when trying to initialize the evdns module in<br />\n      Libevent 2. Bugfix on 0.2.1.16-rc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes (stability):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix an assert in parsing router descriptors containing IPv6<br />\n      addresses. This one took down the directory authorities when<br />\n      somebody tried some experimental code. Bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha.</li>\n<li>Fix an uncommon assertion failure when running with DNSPort under<br />\n      heavy load. Fixes bug 2933; bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Treat an unset $HOME like an empty $HOME rather than triggering an<br />\n      assert. Bugfix on 0.0.8pre1; fixes bug 1522.</li>\n<li>More gracefully handle corrupt state files, removing asserts<br />\n      in favor of saving a backup and resetting state.</li>\n<li>Instead of giving an assertion failure on an internal mismatch<br />\n      on estimated freelist size, just log a BUG warning and try later.<br />\n      Mitigates but does not fix bug 1125.</li>\n<li>Fix an assert that got triggered when using the TestingTorNetwork<br />\n      configuration option and then issuing a GETINFO config-text control<br />\n      command. Fixes bug 2250; bugfix on 0.2.1.2-alpha.</li>\n<li>If the cached cert file is unparseable, warn but don't exit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Privacy fixes (relays/bridges):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't list Windows capabilities in relay descriptors. We never made<br />\n      use of them, and maybe it's a bad idea to publish them. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.1.1.8-alpha.</li>\n<li>If the Nickname configuration option isn't given, Tor would pick a<br />\n      nickname based on the local hostname as the nickname for a relay.<br />\n      Because nicknames are not very important in today's Tor and the<br />\n      \"Unnamed\" nickname has been implemented, this is now problematic<br />\n      behavior: It leaks information about the hostname without being<br />\n      useful at all. Fixes bug 2979; bugfix on 0.1.2.2-alpha, which<br />\n      introduced the Unnamed nickname. Reported by tagnaq.</li>\n<li>Maintain separate TLS contexts and certificates for incoming and<br />\n      outgoing connections in bridge relays. Previously we would use the<br />\n      same TLS contexts and certs for incoming and outgoing connections.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; addresses bug 988.</li>\n<li>Maintain separate identity keys for incoming and outgoing TLS<br />\n      contexts in bridge relays. Previously we would use the same<br />\n      identity keys for incoming and outgoing TLS contexts. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.0.3-alpha; addresses the other half of bug 988.</li>\n<li>Make the bridge directory authority refuse to answer directory<br />\n      requests for \"all descriptors\". It used to include bridge<br />\n      descriptors in its answer, which was a major information leak.<br />\n      Found by \"piebeer\". Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Privacy fixes (clients):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>When receiving a hidden service descriptor, check that it is for<br />\n      the hidden service we wanted. Previously, Tor would store any<br />\n      hidden service descriptors that a directory gave it, whether it<br />\n      wanted them or not. This wouldn't have let an attacker impersonate<br />\n      a hidden service, but it did let directories pre-seed a client<br />\n      with descriptors that it didn't want. Bugfix on 0.0.6.</li>\n<li>Start the process of disabling \".exit\" address notation, since it<br />\n      can be used for a variety of esoteric application-level attacks<br />\n      on users. To reenable it, set \"AllowDotExit 1\" in your torrc. Fix<br />\n      on 0.0.9rc5.</li>\n<li>Reject attempts at the client side to open connections to private<br />\n      IP addresses (like 127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.1, and so on) with<br />\n      a randomly chosen exit node. Attempts to do so are always<br />\n      ill-defined, generally prevented by exit policies, and usually<br />\n      in error. This will also help to detect loops in transparent<br />\n      proxy configurations. You can disable this feature by setting<br />\n      \"ClientRejectInternalAddresses 0\" in your torrc.</li>\n<li>Log a notice when we get a new control connection. Now it's easier<br />\n      for security-conscious users to recognize when a local application<br />\n      is knocking on their controller door. Suggested by bug 1196.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Privacy fixes (newnym):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid linkability based on cached hidden service descriptors: forget<br />\n      all hidden service descriptors cached as a client when processing a<br />\n      SIGNAL NEWNYM command. Fixes bug 3000; bugfix on 0.0.6.</li>\n<li>On SIGHUP, do not clear out all TrackHostExits mappings, client<br />\n      DNS cache entries, and virtual address mappings: that's what<br />\n      NEWNYM is for. Fixes bug 1345; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>Don't attach new streams to old rendezvous circuits after SIGNAL<br />\n      NEWNYM. Previously, we would keep using an existing rendezvous<br />\n      circuit if it remained open (i.e. if it were kept open by a<br />\n      long-lived stream, or if a new stream were attached to it before<br />\n      Tor could notice that it was old and no longer in use). Bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.1.15-rc; fixes bug 3375.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes (relay bandwidth accounting):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a bug that could break accounting on 64-bit systems with large<br />\n      time_t values, making them hibernate for impossibly long intervals.<br />\n      Fixes bug 2146. Bugfix on 0.0.9pre6; fix by boboper.</li>\n<li>Fix a bug in bandwidth accounting that could make us use twice<br />\n      the intended bandwidth when our interval start changes due to<br />\n      daylight saving time. Now we tolerate skew in stored vs computed<br />\n      interval starts: if the start of the period changes by no more than<br />\n      50% of the period's duration, we remember bytes that we transferred<br />\n      in the old period. Fixes bug 1511; bugfix on 0.0.9pre5.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes (bridges):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Bridges now use \"reject *:*\" as their default exit policy. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.3-alpha. Fixes bug 1113.</li>\n<li>If you configure your bridge with a known identity fingerprint,<br />\n      and the bridge authority is unreachable (as it is in at least<br />\n      one country now), fall back to directly requesting the descriptor<br />\n      from the bridge. Finishes the feature started in 0.2.0.10-alpha;<br />\n      closes bug 1138.</li>\n<li>Fix a bug where bridge users who configure the non-canonical<br />\n      address of a bridge automatically switch to its canonical<br />\n      address. If a bridge listens at more than one address, it<br />\n      should be able to advertise those addresses independently and<br />\n      any non-blocked addresses should continue to work. Bugfix on Tor<br />\n      0.2.0.3-alpha. Fixes bug 2510.</li>\n<li>If you configure Tor to use bridge A, and then quit and<br />\n      configure Tor to use bridge B instead (or if you change Tor<br />\n      to use bridge B via the controller), it would happily continue<br />\n      to use bridge A if it's still reachable. While this behavior is<br />\n      a feature if your goal is connectivity, in some scenarios it's a<br />\n      dangerous bug. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha; fixes bug 2511.</li>\n<li>When the controller configures a new bridge, don't wait 10 to 60<br />\n      seconds before trying to fetch its descriptor. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 3198 (suggested by 2355).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes (directory authorities):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Many relays have been falling out of the consensus lately because<br />\n      not enough authorities know about their descriptor for them to get<br />\n      a majority of votes. When we deprecated the v2 directory protocol,<br />\n      we got rid of the only way that v3 authorities can hear from each<br />\n      other about other descriptors. Now authorities examine every v3<br />\n      vote for new descriptors, and fetch them from that authority. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.1.23.</li>\n<li>Authorities could be tricked into giving out the Exit flag to relays<br />\n      that didn't allow exiting to any ports. This bug could screw<br />\n      with load balancing and stats. Bugfix on 0.1.1.6-alpha; fixes bug<br />\n      1238. Bug discovered by Martin Kowalczyk.</li>\n<li>If all authorities restart at once right before a consensus vote,<br />\n      nobody will vote about \"Running\", and clients will get a consensus<br />\n      with no usable relays. Instead, authorities refuse to build a<br />\n      consensus if this happens. Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes bug 1066.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes (stream-level fairness):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>When receiving a circuit-level SENDME for a blocked circuit, try<br />\n      to package cells fairly from all the streams that had previously<br />\n      been blocked on that circuit. Previously, we had started with the<br />\n      oldest stream, and allowed each stream to potentially exhaust<br />\n      the circuit's package window. This gave older streams on any<br />\n      given circuit priority over newer ones. Fixes bug 1937. Detected<br />\n      originally by Camilo Viecco. This bug was introduced before the<br />\n      first Tor release, in svn commit r152: it is the new winner of<br />\n      the longest-lived bug prize.</li>\n<li>Fix a stream fairness bug that would cause newer streams on a given<br />\n      circuit to get preference when reading bytes from the origin or<br />\n      destination. Fixes bug 2210. Fix by Mashael AlSabah. This bug was<br />\n      introduced before the first Tor release, in svn revision r152.</li>\n<li>When the exit relay got a circuit-level sendme cell, it started<br />\n      reading on the exit streams, even if had 500 cells queued in the<br />\n      circuit queue already, so the circuit queue just grew and grew in<br />\n      some cases. We fix this by not re-enabling reading on receipt of a<br />\n      sendme cell when the cell queue is blocked. Fixes bug 1653. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.1-alpha. Detected by Mashael AlSabah. Original patch by<br />\n      \"yetonetime\".</li>\n<li>Newly created streams were allowed to read cells onto circuits,<br />\n      even if the circuit's cell queue was blocked and waiting to drain.<br />\n      This created potential unfairness, as older streams would be<br />\n      blocked, but newer streams would gladly fill the queue completely.<br />\n      We add code to detect this situation and prevent any stream from<br />\n      getting more than one free cell. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha. Partially<br />\n      fixes bug 1298.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes (hidden services):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Apply circuit timeouts to opened hidden-service-related circuits<br />\n      based on the correct start time. Previously, we would apply the<br />\n      circuit build timeout based on time since the circuit's creation;<br />\n      it was supposed to be applied based on time since the circuit<br />\n      entered its current state. Bugfix on 0.0.6; fixes part of bug 1297.</li>\n<li>Improve hidden service robustness: When we find that we have<br />\n      extended a hidden service's introduction circuit to a relay not<br />\n      listed as an introduction point in the HS descriptor we currently<br />\n      have, retry with an introduction point from the current<br />\n      descriptor. Previously we would just give up. Fixes bugs 1024 and<br />\n      1930; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities now use data collected from their own<br />\n      uptime observations when choosing whether to assign the HSDir flag<br />\n      to relays, instead of trusting the uptime value the relay reports in<br />\n      its descriptor. This change helps prevent an attack where a small<br />\n      set of nodes with frequently-changing identity keys can blackhole<br />\n      a hidden service. (Only authorities need upgrade; others will be<br />\n      fine once they do.) Bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes bug 2709.</li>\n<li>Stop assigning the HSDir flag to relays that disable their<br />\n      DirPort (and thus will refuse to answer directory requests). This<br />\n      fix should dramatically improve the reachability of hidden services:<br />\n      hidden services and hidden service clients pick six HSDir relays<br />\n      to store and retrieve the hidden service descriptor, and currently<br />\n      about half of the HSDir relays will refuse to work. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes part of bug 1693.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes (misc):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Clients now stop trying to use an exit node associated with a given<br />\n      destination by TrackHostExits if they fail to reach that exit node.<br />\n      Fixes bug 2999.

Now, we use up 95% of our allotment,<br />\n      AND make sure that we have no more than 500MB (or 3 hours of<br />\n      expected traffic, whichever is lower) remaining before we enter<br />\n      soft hibernation.</li>\n<li>Relays now log the reason for publishing a new relay descriptor,<br />\n      so we have a better chance of hunting down instances of bug 1810.<br />\n      Resolves ticket 3252.</li>\n<li>Log a little more clearly about the times at which we're no longer<br />\n      accepting new connections (e.g. due to hibernating).

Otherwise<br />\n      there will still be clients that see the relay in their consensus,<br />\n      and the stats will end up wrong. Bugfix on 0.2.1.15-rc; fixes<br />\n      bug 932.</li>\n<li>Update to the August 2 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (clients):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>When expiring circuits, use microsecond timers rather than<br />\n      one-second timers. This can avoid an unpleasant situation where a<br />\n      circuit is launched near the end of one second and expired right<br />\n      near the beginning of the next, and prevent fluctuations in circuit<br />\n      timeout values.</li>\n<li>If we've configured EntryNodes and our network goes away and/or all<br />\n      our entrynodes get marked down, optimistically retry them all when<br />\n      a new socks application request appears. Fixes bug 1882.</li>\n<li>Always perform router selections using weighted relay bandwidth,<br />\n      even if we don't need a high capacity circuit at the time. Non-fast<br />\n      circuits now only differ from fast ones in that they can use relays<br />\n      not marked with the Fast flag. This \"feature\" could turn out to<br />\n      be a horrible bug; we should investigate more before it goes into<br />\n      a stable release.</li>\n<li>When we run out of directory information such that we can't build<br />\n      circuits, but then get enough that we can build circuits, log when<br />\n      we actually construct a circuit, so the user has a better chance of<br />\n      knowing what's going on. Fixes bug 1362.</li>\n<li>Log SSL state transitions at debug level during handshake, and<br />\n      include SSL states in error messages. This may help debug future<br />\n      SSL handshake issues.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (directory authorities):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>When a router changes IP address or port, authorities now launch<br />\n      a new reachability test for it. Implements ticket 1899.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities now reject relays running any versions of<br />\n      Tor between 0.2.1.3-alpha and 0.2.1.18 inclusive; they have<br />\n      known bugs that keep RELAY_EARLY cells from working on rendezvous<br />\n      circuits. Followup to fix for bug 2081.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities now reject relays running any version of Tor<br />\n      older than 0.2.0.26-rc. That version is the earliest that fetches<br />\n      current directory information correctly. Fixes bug 2156.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities now do an immediate reachability check as soon<br />\n      as they hear about a new relay. This change should slightly reduce<br />\n      the time between setting up a relay and getting listed as running<br />\n      in the consensus. It should also improve the time between setting<br />\n      up a bridge and seeing use by bridge users.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities no longer launch a TLS connection to every<br />\n      relay as they startup. Now that we have 2k+ descriptors cached,<br />\n      the resulting network hiccup is becoming a burden. Besides,<br />\n      authorities already avoid voting about Running for the first half<br />\n      hour of their uptime.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities now log the source of a rejected POSTed v3<br />\n      networkstatus vote, so we can track failures better.</li>\n<li>Backport code from 0.2.3.x that allows directory authorities to<br />\n      clean their microdescriptor caches. Needed to resolve bug 2230.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (hidden services):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Use computed circuit-build timeouts to decide when to launch<br />\n      parallel introduction circuits for hidden services. (Previously,<br />\n      we would retry after 15 seconds.)</li>\n<li>Don't allow v0 hidden service authorities to act as clients.<br />\n      Required by fix for bug 3000.</li>\n<li>Ignore SIGNAL NEWNYM commands on relay-only Tor instances. Required<br />\n      by fix for bug 3000.</li>\n<li>Make hidden services work better in private Tor networks by not<br />\n      requiring any uptime to join the hidden service descriptor<br />\n      DHT. Implements ticket 2088.</li>\n<li>Log (at info level) when purging pieces of hidden-service-client<br />\n      state because of SIGNAL NEWNYM.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (controller interface):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>New \"GETINFO net/listeners/(type)\" controller command to return<br />\n      a list of addresses and ports that are bound for listeners for a<br />\n      given connection type. This is useful when the user has configured<br />\n      \"SocksPort auto\" and the controller needs to know which port got<br />\n      chosen. Resolves another part of ticket 3076.</li>\n<li>Have the controller interface give a more useful message than<br />\n      \"Internal Error\" in response to failed GETINFO requests.</li>\n<li>Add a TIMEOUT_RATE keyword to the BUILDTIMEOUT_SET control port<br />\n      event, to give information on the current rate of circuit timeouts<br />\n      over our stored history.</li>\n<li>The 'EXTENDCIRCUIT' control port command can now be used with<br />\n      a circ id of 0 and no path. This feature will cause Tor to build<br />\n      a new 'fast' general purpose circuit using its own path selection<br />\n      algorithms.</li>\n<li>Added a BUILDTIMEOUT_SET controller event to describe changes<br />\n      to the circuit build timeout.</li>\n<li>New controller command \"getinfo config-text\". It returns the<br />\n      contents that Tor would write if you send it a SAVECONF command,<br />\n      so the controller can write the file to disk itself.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (controller protocol):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a new ControlSocketsGroupWritable configuration option: when<br />\n      it is turned on, ControlSockets are group-writeable by the default<br />\n      group of the current user. Patch by J√©r√©my Bobbio; implements<br />\n      ticket 2972.</li>\n<li>Tor now refuses to create a ControlSocket in a directory that is<br />\n      world-readable (or group-readable if ControlSocketsGroupWritable<br />\n      is 0). This is necessary because some operating systems do not<br />\n      enforce permissions on an AF_UNIX sockets. Permissions on the<br />\n      directory holding the socket, however, seems to work everywhere.</li>\n<li>Warn when CookieAuthFileGroupReadable is set but CookieAuthFile is<br />\n      not. This would lead to a cookie that is still not group readable.<br />\n      Closes bug 1843. Suggested by katmagic.</li>\n<li>Future-proof the controller protocol a bit by ignoring keyword<br />\n      arguments we do not recognize.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (more useful logging):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Revise most log messages that refer to nodes by nickname to<br />\n      instead use the \"$key=nickname at address\" format. This should be<br />\n      more useful, especially since nicknames are less and less likely<br />\n      to be unique. Resolves ticket 3045.</li>\n<li>When an HTTPS proxy reports \"403 Forbidden\", we now explain<br />\n      what it means rather than calling it an unexpected status code.<br />\n      Closes bug 2503. Patch from Michael Yakubovich.</li>\n<li>Rate-limit a warning about failures to download v2 networkstatus<br />\n      documents. Resolves part of bug 1352.</li>\n<li>Rate-limit the \"your application is giving Tor only an IP address\"<br />\n      warning. Addresses bug 2000; bugfix on 0.0.8pre2.</li>\n<li>Rate-limit \"Failed to hand off onionskin\" warnings.</li>\n<li>When logging a rate-limited warning, we now mention how many messages<br />\n      got suppressed since the last warning.</li>\n<li>Make the formerly ugly \"2 unknown, 7 missing key, 0 good, 0 bad,<br />\n      2 no signature, 4 required\" messages about consensus signatures<br />\n      easier to read, and make sure they get logged at the same severity<br />\n      as the messages explaining which keys are which. Fixes bug 1290.</li>\n<li>Don't warn when we have a consensus that we can't verify because<br />\n      of missing certificates, unless those certificates are ones<br />\n      that we have been trying and failing to download. Fixes bug 1145.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (log domains):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Add documentation for configuring logging at different severities in<br />\n      different log domains. We've had this feature since 0.2.1.1-alpha,<br />\n      but for some reason it never made it into the manpage. Fixes<br />\n      bug 2215.</li>\n<li>Make it simpler to specify \"All log domains except for A and B\".<br />\n      Previously you needed to say \"[*,~A,~B]\". Now you can just say<br />\n      \"[~A,~B]\".</li>\n<li>Add a \"LogMessageDomains 1\" option to include the domains of log<br />\n      messages along with the messages. Without this, there's no way<br />\n      to use log domains without reading the source or doing a lot<br />\n      of guessing.</li>\n<li>Add a new \"Handshake\" log domain for activities that happen<br />\n      during the TLS handshake.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (build process):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Make compilation with clang possible when using<br />\n      \"--enable-gcc-warnings\" by removing two warning options that clang<br />\n      hasn't implemented yet and by fixing a few warnings. Resolves<br />\n      ticket 2696.</li>\n<li>Detect platforms that brokenly use a signed size_t, and refuse to<br />\n      build there. Found and analyzed by doorss and rransom.</li>\n<li>Fix a bunch of compile warnings revealed by mingw with gcc 4.5.<br />\n      Resolves bug 2314.</li>\n<li>Add support for statically linking zlib by specifying<br />\n      \"--enable-static-zlib\", to go with our support for statically<br />\n      linking openssl and libevent. Resolves bug 1358.</li>\n<li>Instead of adding the svn revision to the Tor version string, report<br />\n      the git commit (when we're building from a git checkout).</li>\n<li>Rename the \"log.h\" header to \"torlog.h\" so as to conflict with fewer<br />\n      system headers.</li>\n<li>New --digests command-line switch to output the digests of the<br />\n      source files Tor was built with.</li>\n<li>Generate our manpage and HTML documentation using Asciidoc. This<br />\n      change should make it easier to maintain the documentation, and<br />\n      produce nicer HTML. The build process fails if asciidoc cannot<br />\n      be found and building with asciidoc isn't disabled (via the<br />\n      \"--disable-asciidoc\" argument to ./configure. Skipping the manpage<br />\n      speeds up the build considerably.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (options / torrc):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Warn when the same option is provided more than once in a torrc<br />\n      file, on the command line, or in a single SETCONF statement, and<br />\n      the option is one that only accepts a single line. Closes bug 1384.</li>\n<li>Warn when the user configures two HiddenServiceDir lines that point<br />\n      to the same directory. Bugfix on 0.0.6 (the version introducing<br />\n      HiddenServiceDir); fixes bug 3289.</li>\n<li>Add new \"perconnbwrate\" and \"perconnbwburst\" consensus params to<br />\n      do individual connection-level rate limiting of clients. The torrc<br />\n      config options with the same names trump the consensus params, if<br />\n      both are present. Replaces the old \"bwconnrate\" and \"bwconnburst\"<br />\n      consensus params which were broken from 0.2.2.7-alpha through<br />\n      0.2.2.14-alpha. Closes bug 1947.</li>\n<li>New config option \"WarnUnsafeSocks 0\" disables the warning that<br />\n      occurs whenever Tor receives a socks handshake using a version of<br />\n      the socks protocol that can only provide an IP address (rather<br />\n      than a hostname). Setups that do DNS locally over Tor are fine,<br />\n      and we shouldn't spam the logs in that case.</li>\n<li>New config option \"CircuitStreamTimeout\" to override our internal<br />\n      timeout schedule for how many seconds until we detach a stream from<br />\n      a circuit and try a new circuit. If your network is particularly<br />\n      slow, you might want to set this to a number like 60.</li>\n<li>New options for SafeLogging to allow scrubbing only log messages<br />\n      generated while acting as a relay. Specify \"SafeLogging relay\" if<br />\n      you want to ensure that only messages known to originate from<br />\n      client use of the Tor process will be logged unsafely.</li>\n<li>Time and memory units in the configuration file can now be set to<br />\n      fractional units. For example, \"2.5 GB\" is now a valid value for<br />\n      AccountingMax.</li>\n<li>Support line continuations in the torrc config file. If a line<br />\n      ends with a single backslash character, the newline is ignored, and<br />\n      the configuration value is treated as continuing on the next line.<br />\n      Resolves bug 1929.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (unit tests):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Revise our unit tests to use the \"tinytest\" framework, so we<br />\n      can run tests in their own processes, have smarter setup/teardown<br />\n      code, and so on. The unit test code has moved to its own<br />\n      subdirectory, and has been split into multiple modules.</li>\n<li>Add a unit test for cross-platform directory-listing code.</li>\n<li>Add some forgotten return value checks during unit tests. Found<br />\n      by coverity.</li>\n<li>Use GetTempDir to find the proper temporary directory location on<br />\n      Windows when generating temporary files for the unit tests. Patch<br />\n      by Gisle Vanem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (misc):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The \"torify\" script now uses torsocks where available.</li>\n<li>Make Libevent log messages get delivered to controllers later,<br />\n      and not from inside the Libevent log handler. This prevents unsafe<br />\n      reentrant Libevent calls while still letting the log messages<br />\n      get through.</li>\n<li>Certain Tor clients (such as those behind check.torproject.org) may<br />\n      want to fetch the consensus in an extra early manner. To enable this<br />\n      a user may now set FetchDirInfoExtraEarly to 1. This also depends on<br />\n      setting FetchDirInfoEarly to 1. Previous behavior will stay the same<br />\n      as only certain clients who must have this information sooner should<br />\n      set this option.</li>\n<li>Expand homedirs passed to tor-checkkey. This should silence a<br />\n      coverity complaint about passing a user-supplied string into<br />\n      open() without checking it.</li>\n<li>Make sure to disable DirPort if running as a bridge. DirPorts aren't<br />\n      used on bridges, and it makes bridge scanning somewhat easier.</li>\n<li>Create the /var/run/tor directory on startup on OpenSUSE if it is<br />\n      not already created. Patch from Andreas Stieger. Fixes bug 2573.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (relays):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>When a relay decides that its DNS is too broken for it to serve<br />\n      as an exit server, it advertised itself as a non-exit, but<br />\n      continued to act as an exit. This could create accidental<br />\n      partitioning opportunities for users. Instead, if a relay is<br />\n      going to advertise reject *:* as its exit policy, it should<br />\n      really act with exit policy \"reject *:*\". Fixes bug 2366.<br />\n      Bugfix on Tor 0.1.2.5-alpha. Bugfix by user \"postman\" on trac.</li>\n<li>Publish a router descriptor even if generating an extra-info<br />\n      descriptor fails. Previously we would not publish a router<br />\n      descriptor without an extra-info descriptor; this can cause fast<br />\n      exit relays collecting exit-port statistics to drop from the<br />\n      consensus. Bugfix on 0.1.2.9-rc; fixes bug 2195.</li>\n<li>When we're trying to guess whether we know our IP address as<br />\n      a relay, we would log various ways that we failed to guess<br />\n      our address, but never log that we ended up guessing it<br />\n      successfully. Now add a log line to help confused and anxious<br />\n      relay operators. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha; fixes bug 1534.</li>\n<li>For bandwidth accounting, calculate our expected bandwidth rate<br />\n      based on the time during which we were active and not in<br />\n      soft-hibernation during the last interval. Previously, we were<br />\n      also considering the time spent in soft-hibernation. If this<br />\n      was a long time, we would wind up underestimating our bandwidth<br />\n      by a lot, and skewing our wakeup time towards the start of the<br />\n      accounting interval. Fixes bug 1789. Bugfix on 0.0.9pre5.</li>\n<li>Demote a confusing TLS warning that relay operators might get when<br />\n      someone tries to talk to their ORPort. It is not the operator's<br />\n      fault, nor can they do anything about it. Fixes bug 1364; bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.14-alpha.</li>\n<li>Change \"Application request when we're believed to be offline.\"<br />\n      notice to \"Application request when we haven't used client<br />\n      functionality lately.\", to clarify that it's not an error. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.0.9.3; fixes bug 1222.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (bridges):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>When a client starts or stops using bridges, never use a circuit<br />\n      that was built before the configuration change. This behavior could<br />\n      put at risk a user who uses bridges to ensure that her traffic<br />\n      only goes to the chosen addresses. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes<br />\n      bug 3200.</li>\n<li>Do not reset the bridge descriptor download status every time we<br />\n      re-parse our configuration or get a configuration change. Fixes<br />\n      bug 3019; bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>\n<li>Users couldn't configure a regular relay to be their bridge. It<br />\n      didn't work because when Tor fetched the bridge descriptor, it found<br />\n      that it already had it, and didn't realize that the purpose of the<br />\n      descriptor had changed. Now we replace routers with a purpose other<br />\n      than bridge with bridge descriptors when fetching them. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.1.9-alpha. Fixes bug 1776.</li>\n<li>In the special case where you configure a public exit relay as your<br />\n      bridge, Tor would be willing to use that exit relay as the last<br />\n      hop in your circuit as well. Now we fail that circuit instead.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.0.12-alpha. Fixes bug 2403. Reported by \"piebeer\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (clients):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>We now ask the other side of a stream (the client or the exit)<br />\n      for more data on that stream when the amount of queued data on<br />\n      that stream dips low enough. Previously, we wouldn't ask the<br />\n      other side for more data until either it sent us more data (which<br />\n      it wasn't supposed to do if it had exhausted its window!) or we<br />\n      had completely flushed all our queued data. This flow control fix<br />\n      should improve throughput. Fixes bug 2756; bugfix on the earliest<br />\n      released versions of Tor (svn commit r152).</li>\n<li>When a client finds that an origin circuit has run out of 16-bit<br />\n      stream IDs, we now mark it as unusable for new streams. Previously,<br />\n      we would try to close the entire circuit. Bugfix on 0.0.6.</li>\n<li>Make it explicit that we don't cannibalize one-hop circuits. This<br />\n      happens in the wild, but doesn't turn out to be a problem because<br />\n      we fortunately don't use those circuits. Many thanks to outofwords<br />\n      for the initial analysis and to swissknife who confirmed that<br />\n      two-hop circuits are actually created.</li>\n<li>Resolve an edge case in path weighting that could make us misweight<br />\n      our relay selection. Fixes bug 1203; bugfix on 0.0.8rc1.</li>\n<li>Make the DNSPort option work with libevent 2.x. Don't alter the<br />\n      behaviour for libevent 1.x. Fixes bug 1143. Found by SwissTorExit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (directory authorities):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Make directory authorities more accurate at recording when<br />\n      relays that have failed several reachability tests became<br />\n      unreachable, so we can provide more accuracy at assigning Stable,<br />\n      Guard, HSDir, etc flags. Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha. Resolves bug 2716.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities are now more robust to hops back in time<br />\n      when calculating router stability. Previously, if a run of uptime<br />\n      or downtime appeared to be negative, the calculation could give<br />\n      incorrect results. Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha; noticed when fixing<br />\n      bug 1035.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities will now attempt to download consensuses<br />\n      if their own efforts to make a live consensus have failed. This<br />\n      change means authorities that restart will fetch a valid<br />\n      consensus, and it means authorities that didn't agree with the<br />\n      current consensus will still fetch and serve it if it has enough<br />\n      signatures. Bugfix on 0.2.0.9-alpha; fixes bug 1300.</li>\n<li>Never vote for a server as \"Running\" if we have a descriptor for<br />\n      it claiming to be hibernating, and that descriptor was published<br />\n      more recently than our last contact with the server. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 911.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities no longer change their opinion of, or vote on,<br />\n      whether a router is Running, unless they have themselves been<br />\n      online long enough to have some idea. Bugfix on 0.2.0.6-alpha.<br />\n      Fixes bug 1023.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (hidden services):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Log malformed requests for rendezvous descriptors as protocol<br />\n      warnings, not warnings. Also, use a more informative log message<br />\n      in case someone sees it at log level warning without prior<br />\n      info-level messages. Fixes bug 2748; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>\n<li>Accept hidden service descriptors if we think we might be a hidden<br />\n      service directory, regardless of what our consensus says. This<br />\n      helps robustness, since clients and hidden services can sometimes<br />\n      have a more up-to-date view of the network consensus than we do,<br />\n      and if they think that the directory authorities list us a HSDir,<br />\n      we might actually be one. Related to bug 2732; bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>\n<li>Correct the warning displayed when a rendezvous descriptor exceeds<br />\n      the maximum size. Fixes bug 2750; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha. Found by<br />\n      John Brooks.</li>\n<li>Clients and hidden services now use HSDir-flagged relays for hidden<br />\n      service descriptor downloads and uploads even if the relays have no<br />\n      DirPort set and the client has disabled TunnelDirConns. This will<br />\n      eventually allow us to give the HSDir flag to relays with no<br />\n      DirPort. Fixes bug 2722; bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>\n<li>Only limit the lengths of single HS descriptors, even when multiple<br />\n      HS descriptors are published to an HSDir relay in a single POST<br />\n      operation. Fixes bug 2948; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha. Found by hsdir.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (controllers):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow GETINFO fingerprint to return a fingerprint even when<br />\n      we have not yet built a router descriptor.

Bugfix on 0.1.1.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>When we restart our relay, we might get a successful connection<br />\n      from the outside before we've started our reachability tests,<br />\n      triggering a warning: \"ORPort found reachable, but I have no<br />\n      routerinfo yet. Failing to inform controller of success.\" This<br />\n      bug was harmless unless Tor is running under a controller<br />\n      like Vidalia, in which case the controller would never get a<br />\n      REACHABILITY_SUCCEEDED status event. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha;<br />\n      fixes bug 1172.</li>\n<li>When a controller changes TrackHostExits, remove mappings for<br />\n      hosts that should no longer have their exits tracked. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>When a controller changes VirtualAddrNetwork, remove any mappings<br />\n      for hosts that were automapped to the old network. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.1.19-rc.</li>\n<li>When a controller changes one of the AutomapHosts* options, remove<br />\n      any mappings for hosts that should no longer be automapped. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Fix an off-by-one error in calculating some controller command<br />\n      argument lengths. Fortunately, this mistake is harmless since<br />\n      the controller code does redundant NUL termination too. Found by<br />\n      boboper. Bugfix on 0.1.1.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Fix a bug in the controller interface where \"GETINFO ns/asdaskljkl\"<br />\n      would return \"551 Internal error\" rather than \"552 Unrecognized key<br />\n      ns/asdaskljkl\". Bugfix on 0.1.2.3-alpha.</li>\n<li>Don't spam the controller with events when we have no file<br />\n      descriptors available. Bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha. (Rate-limiting<br />\n      for log messages was already solved from bug 748.)</li>\n<li>Emit a GUARD DROPPED controller event for a case we missed.</li>\n<li>Ensure DNS requests launched by \"RESOLVE\" commands from the<br />\n      controller respect the __LeaveStreamsUnattached setconf options. The<br />\n      same goes for requests launched via DNSPort or transparent<br />\n      proxying. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha; fixes bug 1525.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (config options):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Tor used to limit HttpProxyAuthenticator values to 48 characters.<br />\n      Change the limit to 512 characters by removing base64 newlines.<br />\n      Fixes bug 2752. Fix by Michael Yakubovich.</li>\n<li>Complain if PublishServerDescriptor is given multiple arguments that<br />\n      include 0 or 1. This configuration will be rejected in the future.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha; closes bug 1107.</li>\n<li>Disallow BridgeRelay 1 and ORPort 0 at once in the configuration.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.0.13-alpha; closes bug 928.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (log subsystem fixes):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>When unable to format an address as a string, report its value<br />\n      as \"???\" rather than reusing the last formatted address. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.1.5-alpha.</li>\n<li>Be more consistent in our treatment of file system paths. \"~\" should<br />\n      get expanded to the user's home directory in the Log config option.<br />\n      Fixes bug 2971; bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha, which introduced the<br />\n      feature for the -f and --DataDirectory options.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (memory management):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Don't stack-allocate the list of supplementary GIDs when we're<br />\n      about to log them. Stack-allocating NGROUPS_MAX gid_t elements<br />\n      could take up to 256K, which is way too much stack. Found by<br />\n      Coverity; CID #450. Bugfix on 0.2.1.7-alpha.</li>\n<li>Save a couple bytes in memory allocation every time we escape<br />\n      certain characters in a string. Patch from Florian Zumbiehl.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (protocol correctness):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>When checking for 1024-bit keys, check for 1024 bits, not 128<br />\n      bytes. This allows Tor to correctly discard keys of length 1017<br />\n      through 1023. Bugfix on 0.0.9pre5.</li>\n<li>Require that introduction point keys and onion handshake keys<br />\n      have a public exponent of 65537. Starts to fix bug 3207; bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>\n<li>Handle SOCKS messages longer than 128 bytes long correctly, rather<br />\n      than waiting forever for them to finish. Fixes bug 2330; bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Found by doorss.</li>\n<li>Never relay a cell for a circuit we have already destroyed.<br />\n      Between marking a circuit as closeable and finally closing it,<br />\n      it may have been possible for a few queued cells to get relayed,<br />\n      even though they would have been immediately dropped by the next<br />\n      OR in the circuit. Fixes bug 1184; bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Never queue a cell for a circuit that's already been marked<br />\n      for close.</li>\n<li>Fix a spec conformance issue: the network-status-version token<br />\n      must be the first token in a v3 consensus or vote. Discovered by<br />\n      \"parakeep\". Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>\n<li>A networkstatus vote must contain exactly one signature. Spec<br />\n      conformance issue. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>\n<li>When asked about a DNS record type we don't support via a<br />\n      client DNSPort, reply with NOTIMPL rather than an empty<br />\n      reply. Patch by intrigeri. Fixes bug 3369; bugfix on 2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Make more fields in the controller protocol case-insensitive, since<br />\n      control-spec.txt said they were.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (log messages):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a log message that said \"bits\" while displaying a value in<br />\n      bytes. Found by wanoskarnet. Fixes bug 3318; bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Downgrade \"no current certificates known for authority\" message from<br />\n      Notice to Info. Fixes bug 2899; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.</li>\n<li>Correctly describe errors that occur when generating a TLS object.<br />\n      Previously we would attribute them to a failure while generating a<br />\n      TLS context. Patch by Robert Ransom. Bugfix on 0.1.0.4-rc; fixes<br />\n      bug 1994.</li>\n<li>Fix an instance where a Tor directory mirror might accidentally<br />\n      log the IP address of a misbehaving Tor client. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>Stop logging at severity 'warn' when some other Tor client tries<br />\n      to establish a circuit with us using weak DH keys. It's a protocol<br />\n      violation, but that doesn't mean ordinary users need to hear about<br />\n      it. Fixes the bug part of bug 1114. Bugfix on 0.1.0.13.</li>\n<li>If your relay can't keep up with the number of incoming create<br />\n      cells, it would log one warning per failure into your logs. Limit<br />\n      warnings to 1 per minute. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre10; fixes bug 1042.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (build fixes):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix warnings from GCC 4.6's \"-Wunused-but-set-variable\" option.\n<li>When warning about missing zlib development packages during compile,<br />\n      give the correct package names. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Fix warnings that newer versions of autoconf produce during<br />\n      ./autogen.sh. These warnings appear to be harmless in our case,<br />\n      but they were extremely verbose. Fixes bug 2020.</li>\n<li>Squash a compile warning on OpenBSD. Reported by Tas; fixes<br />\n      bug 1848.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (portability):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Write several files in text mode, on OSes that distinguish text<br />\n      mode from binary mode (namely, Windows). These files are:<br />\n      'buffer-stats', 'dirreq-stats', and 'entry-stats' on relays<br />\n      that collect those statistics; 'client_keys' and 'hostname' for<br />\n      hidden services that use authentication; and (in the tor-gencert<br />\n      utility) newly generated identity and signing keys. Previously,<br />\n      we wouldn't specify text mode or binary mode, leading to an<br />\n      assertion failure. Fixes bug 3607. Bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha (when<br />\n      the DirRecordUsageByCountry option which would have triggered<br />\n      the assertion failure was added), although this assertion failure<br />\n      would have occurred in tor-gencert on Windows in 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Selectively disable deprecation warnings on OS X because Lion<br />\n      started deprecating the shipped copy of openssl. Fixes bug 3643.</li>\n<li>Use a wide type to hold sockets when built for 64-bit Windows.<br />\n      Fixes bug 3270.</li>\n<li>Fix an issue that prevented static linking of libevent on<br />\n      some platforms (notably Linux). Fixes bug 2698; bugfix on 0.2.1.23,<br />\n      where we introduced the \"--with-static-libevent\" configure option.</li>\n<li>Fix a bug with our locking implementation on Windows that couldn't<br />\n      correctly detect when a file was already locked. Fixes bug 2504,<br />\n      bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.</li>\n<li>Build correctly on OSX with zlib 1.2.4 and higher with all warnings<br />\n      enabled.</li>\n<li>Fix IPv6-related connect() failures on some platforms (BSD, OS X).<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes first part of bug 2660. Patch by<br />\n      \"piebeer\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (code correctness):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Always NUL-terminate the sun_path field of a sockaddr_un before<br />\n      passing it to the kernel. (Not a security issue: kernels are<br />\n      smart enough to reject bad sockaddr_uns.) Found by Coverity;<br />\n      CID #428. Bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.3-alpha.</li>\n<li>Make connection_printf_to_buf()'s behaviour sane. Its callers<br />\n      expect it to emit a CRLF iff the format string ends with CRLF;<br />\n      it actually emitted a CRLF iff (a) the format string ended with<br />\n      CRLF or (b) the resulting string was over 1023 characters long or<br />\n      (c) the format string did not end with CRLF *and* the resulting<br />\n      string was 1021 characters long or longer. Bugfix on 0.1.1.9-alpha;<br />\n      fixes part of bug 3407.</li>\n<li>Make send_control_event_impl()'s behaviour sane. Its callers<br />\n      expect it to always emit a CRLF at the end of the string; it<br />\n      might have emitted extra control characters as well. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.1.9-alpha; fixes another part of bug 3407.</li>\n<li>Make crypto_rand_int() check the value of its input correctly.<br />\n      Previously, it accepted values up to UINT_MAX, but could return a<br />\n      negative number if given a value above INT_MAX+1. Found by George<br />\n      Kadianakis. Fixes bug 3306; bugfix on 0.2.2pre14.</li>\n<li>Fix a potential null-pointer dereference while computing a<br />\n      consensus. Bugfix on tor-0.2.0.3-alpha, found with the help of<br />\n      clang's analyzer.</li>\n<li>If we fail to compute the identity digest of a v3 legacy keypair,<br />\n      warn, and don't use a buffer-full of junk instead. Bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.1.1-alpha; fixes bug 3106.</li>\n<li>Resolve an untriggerable issue in smartlist_string_num_isin(),<br />\n      where if the function had ever in the future been used to check<br />\n      for the presence of a too-large number, it would have given an<br />\n      incorrect result. (Fortunately, we only used it for 16-bit<br />\n      values.) Fixes bug 3175; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>Be more careful about reporting the correct error from a failed<br />\n      connect() system call. Under some circumstances, it was possible to<br />\n      look at an incorrect value for errno when sending the end reason.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.</li>\n<li>Correctly handle an \"impossible\" overflow cases in connection byte<br />\n      counting, where we write or read more than 4GB on an edge connection<br />\n      in a single second. Bugfix on 0.1.2.8-beta.</li>\n<li>Avoid a double mark-for-free warning when failing to attach a<br />\n      transparent proxy connection. Bugfix on 0.1.2.1-alpha. Fixes<br />\n      bug 2279.</li>\n<li>Correctly detect failure to allocate an OpenSSL BIO. Fixes bug 2378;<br />\n      found by \"cypherpunks\". This bug was introduced before the first<br />\n      Tor release, in svn commit r110.</li>\n<li>Fix a bug in bandwidth history state parsing that could have been<br />\n      triggered if a future version of Tor ever changed the timing<br />\n      granularity at which bandwidth history is measured. Bugfix on<br />\n      Tor 0.1.1.11-alpha.</li>\n<li>Add assertions to check for overflow in arguments to<br />\n      base32_encode() and base32_decode(); fix a signed-unsigned<br />\n      comparison there too. These bugs are not actually reachable in Tor,<br />\n      but it's good to prevent future errors too. Found by doorss.</li>\n<li>Avoid a bogus overlapped memcpy in tor_addr_copy(). Reported by<br />\n      \"memcpyfail\".</li>\n<li>Set target port in get_interface_address6() correctly. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.1.1.4-alpha and 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes second part of bug 2660.</li>\n<li>Fix an impossible-to-actually-trigger buffer overflow in relay<br />\n      descriptor generation. Bugfix on 0.1.0.15.</li>\n<li>Fix numerous small code-flaws found by Coverity Scan Rung 3.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (code improvements):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>After we free an internal connection structure, overwrite it<br />\n      with a different memory value than we use for overwriting a freed<br />\n      internal circuit structure. Should help with debugging. Suggested<br />\n      by bug 1055.</li>\n<li>If OpenSSL fails to make a duplicate of a private or public key, log<br />\n      an error message and try to exit cleanly. May help with debugging<br />\n      if bug 1209 ever remanifests.</li>\n<li>Some options used different conventions for uppercasing of acronyms<br />\n      when comparing manpage and source. Fix those in favor of the<br />\n      manpage, as it makes sense to capitalize acronyms.</li>\n<li>Take a first step towards making or.h smaller by splitting out<br />\n      function definitions for all source files in src/or/. Leave<br />\n      structures and defines in or.h for now.</li>\n<li>Remove a few dead assignments during router parsing. Found by<br />\n      coverity.</li>\n<li>Don't use 1-bit wide signed bit fields. Found by coverity.</li>\n<li>Avoid signed/unsigned comparisons by making SIZE_T_CEILING unsigned.<br />\n      None of the cases where we did this before were wrong, but by making<br />\n      this change we avoid warnings. Fixes bug 2475; bugfix on 0.2.1.28.</li>\n<li>The memarea code now uses a sentinel value at the end of each area<br />\n      to make sure nothing writes beyond the end of an area. This might<br />\n      help debug some conceivable causes of bug 930.</li>\n<li>Always treat failure to allocate an RSA key as an unrecoverable<br />\n      allocation error.</li>\n<li>Add some more defensive programming for architectures that can't<br />\n      handle unaligned integer accesses. We don't know of any actual bugs<br />\n      right now, but that's the best time to fix them. Fixes bug 1943.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (misc):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a rare bug in rend_fn unit tests: we would fail a test when<br />\n      a randomly generated port is 0. Diagnosed by Matt Edman. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.10-alpha; fixes bug 1808.</li>\n<li>Where available, use Libevent 2.0's periodic timers so that our<br />\n      once-per-second cleanup code gets called even more closely to<br />\n      once per second than it would otherwise. Fixes bug 943.</li>\n<li>Ignore OutboundBindAddress when connecting to localhost.<br />\n      Connections to localhost need to come _from_ localhost, or else<br />\n      local servers (like DNS and outgoing HTTP/SOCKS proxies) will often<br />\n      refuse to listen.</li>\n<li>Update our OpenSSL 0.9.8l fix so that it works with OpenSSL 0.9.8m<br />\n      too.</li>\n<li>If any of the v3 certs we download are unparseable, we should<br />\n      actually notice the failure so we don't retry indefinitely. Bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.0.x; reported by \"rotator\".</li>\n<li>When Tor fails to parse a descriptor of any kind, dump it to disk.<br />\n      Might help diagnosing bug 1051.</li>\n<li>Make our 'torify' script more portable; if we have only one of<br />\n      'torsocks' or 'tsocks' installed, don't complain to the user;<br />\n      and explain our warning about tsocks better.</li>\n<li>Fix some urls in the exit notice file and make it XHTML1.1 strict<br />\n      compliant. Based on a patch from Christian Kujau.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Documentation changes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Modernize the doxygen configuration file slightly. Fixes bug 2707.</li>\n<li>Resolve all doxygen warnings except those for missing documentation.<br />\n      Fixes bug 2705.</li>\n<li>Add doxygen documentation for more functions, fields, and types.</li>\n<li>Convert the HACKING file to asciidoc, and add a few new sections<br />\n      to it, explaining how we use Git, how we make changelogs, and<br />\n      what should go in a patch.</li>\n<li>Document the default socks host and port (127.0.0.1:9050) for<br />\n      tor-resolve.</li>\n<li>Removed some unnecessary files from the source distribution. The<br />\n      AUTHORS file has now been merged into the people page on the<br />\n      website. The roadmaps and design doc can now be found in the<br />\n      projects directory in svn.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Deprecated and removed features (config):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove the torrc.complete file. It hasn't been kept up to date<br />\n      and users will have better luck checking out the manpage.</li>\n<li>Remove the HSAuthorityRecordStats option that version 0 hidden<br />\n      service authorities could use to track statistics of overall v0<br />\n      hidden service usage.</li>\n<li>Remove the obsolete \"NoPublish\" option; it has been flagged<br />\n      as obsolete and has produced a warning since 0.1.1.18-rc.</li>\n<li>Caches no longer download and serve v2 networkstatus documents<br />\n      unless FetchV2Networkstatus flag is set: these documents haven't<br />\n      haven't been used by clients or relays since 0.2.0.x. Resolves<br />\n      bug 3022.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Deprecated and removed features (controller):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>The controller no longer accepts the old obsolete \"addr-mappings/\"<br />\n      or \"unregistered-servers-\" GETINFO values.</li>\n<li>The EXTENDED_EVENTS and VERBOSE_NAMES controller features are now<br />\n      always on; using them is necessary for correct forward-compatible<br />\n      controllers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Deprecated and removed features (misc):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Hidden services no longer publish version 0 descriptors, and clients<br />\n      do not request or use version 0 descriptors. However, the old hidden<br />\n      service authorities still accept and serve version 0 descriptors<br />\n      when contacted by older hidden services/clients.</li>\n<li>Remove undocumented option \"-F\" from tor-resolve: it hasn't done<br />\n      anything since 0.2.1.16-rc.</li>\n<li>Remove everything related to building the expert bundle for OS X.<br />\n      It has confused many users, doesn't work right on OS X 10.6,<br />\n      and is hard to get rid of once installed. Resolves bug 1274.</li>\n<li>Remove support for .noconnect style addresses. Nobody was using<br />\n      them, and they provided another avenue for detecting Tor users<br />\n      via application-level web tricks.</li>\n<li>When we fixed bug 1038 we had to put in a restriction not to send<br />\n      RELAY_EARLY cells on rend circuits. This was necessary as long<br />\n      as relays using Tor 0.2.1.3-alpha through 0.2.1.18-alpha were<br />\n      active. Now remove this obsolete check. Resolves bug 2081.</li>\n<li>Remove workaround code to handle directory responses from servers<br />\n      that had bug 539 (they would send HTTP status 503 responses _and_<br />\n      send a body too). Since only server versions before<br />\n      0.2.0.16-alpha/0.1.2.19 were affected, there is no longer reason to<br />\n      keep the workaround in place.</li>\n<li>Remove the old 'fuzzy time' logic. It was supposed to be used for<br />\n      handling calculations where we have a known amount of clock skew and<br />\n      an allowed amount of unknown skew. But we only used it in three<br />\n      places, and we never adjusted the known/unknown skew values. This is<br />\n      still something we might want to do someday, but if we do, we'll<br />\n      want to do it differently.</li>\n<li>Remove the \"--enable-iphone\" option to ./configure. According to<br />\n      reports from Marco Bonetti, Tor builds fine without any special<br />\n      tweaking on recent iPhone SDK versions.</li>\n</ul>"

It was a really nice experience, I learned a lot, met a lot of nice people on irc, and earned some money.</p>\n<p>My project was to create a <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/jvoisin/mat.git\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit</a> (MAT), to improve privacy of online file publications. First, I heavily based my code on <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/haypo/hachoir/wiki/Home\" rel=\"nofollow\">hachoir</a> (a nice, but a slightly complex library), but now, must of the formats that the MAT supports do not use hachoir.<br />\n Despite several code restructuring and re-factorizations, silly ideas, re-implementations, and re-writing/... the MAT is living !</p>\n<p>I made two big mistakes. The first being using python2.7, and <a href=\"https://live.gnome.org/PyGObject\" rel=\"nofollow\">pygobject</a>. Neither of these were in Debian stable/tails, so I had to rewrite those parts.</p>\n<p>MAP consists of a modular API (feel free to add support for other formats !), a command line interface, and a graphic user interface (powered by pygtk).</p>\n<p>It was my first \"serious\" project in python, and I was the first surprised about the ~3000 lines of code I produced. I'm pretty proud of the \"pdf processing part\", and I'm sad about the setup.py/packaging part (that are the most ugly/dirty/painful things that I ever touched/coded ).</p>\n<p>I'm still unhappy with my code/piece of software, so I'll continue to improve it, so expect great work in the future, such as an <a href=\"http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/\" rel=\"nofollow\">exiftool</a> binding, watermark counter-measures, ..</p>\n<p>Thank you mikeperry for being my mentor, thank you google for the amazing GSoC project, thank to every user that gave me feedback (and even more stuff to fix!), and special thanks to haypo, Mc2`, Kiri, intrigeri, bertagaz, Lunar^ and all #tails/#tor-dev !</p>\n<p>Hope to see you next year.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Recently it has come to the attention of, well, nearly the entire world that the Dutch Certificate Authority DigiNotar incorrectly issued certificates to a malicious party or parties. Even more recently, it's come to light that they were apparently compromised months ago or <a href=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002228.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">perhaps even in May of 2009</a> if not earlier.</p>\n<p>This is pretty unfortunate, since correctly issuing certificates is exactly the function that a certificate authority (CA) is supposed to perform.  By comparison, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/detecting-certificate-authority-compromises-and-web-browser-collusion\" rel=\"nofollow\">ComodoGate</a> looks fairly minor.</p>\n<p><strong>This incident doesn't affect the functionality of Tor clients or the Tor Network itself, since Tor doesn't use the flawed CA system.</strong> The Tor network uses a much simpler and flatter <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#KeyManagement\" rel=\"nofollow\">trust design</a> that protects us from many of these CA issues. Further, Tor's <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/images/htw2.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">distributed-trust</a> design limits the damage from compromise of any given network component.</p>\n<p>But the incident <em>does</em> affect users that are attempting to reach The Tor Project's infrastructure: with one of these bogus certificates, an attacker could convince your browser that you were talking to The Tor Project website, when really you were talking to the attacker.</p>\n<p>We have taken direct action in an attempt to stop this kind of attack in the future with two major browser vendors and we hope to integrate a fix with all other willing browsers.  Please contact us if you ship a browser and you'd like to help your users to be proactively secure when visiting our sites.  TorBrowser users should upgrade to our latest release and <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en\" rel=\"nofollow\">verify signatures</a> for all downloaded files. All Tor Browser Bundles have been updated to Firefox 6 with a patch to stop trusting the offending CA, and users are encouraged to upgrade.  Below, we describe what we found out, what we're doing about it, and what you should do to keep yourself safe.</p>\n<p><strong>The attack</strong></p>\n<p>In the last seventy-two hours we were working to find positive confirmation that The Tor Project was one of the targeted groups. It was originally disclosed that at least <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/ff7Yg663\" rel=\"nofollow\">one</a> <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/google.com_.crt_.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">certificate</a> was issued for '*.google.com' and that it was being used <a href=\"https://www.google.com/support/forum/p/gmail/thread?tid=2da6158b094b225a&amp;hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">to actively Man-In-The-Middle</a> SSL and TLS connections. Quite quickly we found a similar pattern to the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/detecting-certificate-authority-compromises-and-web-browser-collusion\" rel=\"nofollow\">ComodoGate fiasco</a>. It appears likely that the Mozilla Addons site, Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, and a few other major players were targeted. We do not have an authoritative list but I personally believe those targets to be accurate; time will tell.  Additionally, we heard rumors that <a href=\"http://www.nu.nl/internet/2603449/mogelijk-nepsoftware-verspreid-naast-aftappen-gmail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">we had graduated to the big leagues</a> and we had also heard that DigiNotar had reached out to the major browser vendors. We did not receive any proactive contact from DigiNotar as a browser vendor and this worried us greatly when compounded with the rumor of being one of the targets as well.</p>\n<p>We ship a <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">rather specific and special browser</a> and it appeared that all of our sites are specifically in the attacker's target list. Having received no contact from DigiNotar, we reached out to DigiNotar by email and by telephone.</p>\n<p>I spoke on the telephone with a rather nice but obviously overworked DigiNotar point of contact who will remain anonymous. He was guarded and careful in what he said but was clearly sympathetic to the severity of the matter at hand. It seemed quite clear that he repeated similar information to other impacted callers:</p>\n<p>\"What I can say is the following \" ... \"Any fraudulent torproject.org certificate that has been requested has been revoked. Any serial numbers that we know about have been revoked. All serial numbers have been communicated to the major browsers vendors.\" ... \"Any certificate that we know of is revoked by OCSP server.\"</p>\n<p>We emailed quite a bit back and forth after the phone call. A few hours later that same point of contact from DigiNotar sent <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/DigiNotar-Tor-serial-list.xls\" rel=\"nofollow\">a list of all of the certificates in a spreadsheet</a>. It appears that the attackers requested twelve certificates, and each certificate was for '*.torproject.org'. The first batch of six certificates was issued on July 18th and the second batch of six certificates was issued on July 20th. According to the spreadsheet, the first six of the certificates expired on August 17th, 2011 and second batch of six certificates expired on August 19th, 2011.  According to the information disclosed by DigiNotar the certificates in question should all have expired. The contact at DigiNotar stressed that there was no confirmation about the attacker(s) receiving the certificates. I have no reason to believe that these certificates would have any more trouble reaching the requesting party than the Google certificate used in the wild.</p>\n<p>This is the current list of serial numbers for all twelve Tor Project certificates as disclosed to us by DigiNotar:</p>\n<p>         899AE120CD44FCEC0FFCD62F6FC4BB81<br />\n         7DD16C03DF0438B2BE5FC1D3E19F138B<br />\n         5432FC98141883F780897BC829EB9080<br />\n         73024E7C998B3DDD244CFD313D5E43B6<br />\n         B01D8C6F2D5373EABF0C00319E92AE95<br />\n         FF789632B8D4AECD94A0AAB33074A058<br />\n         86633B957280BC65A5ADFD1D153BDE52<br />\n         E7F58683066112DC5EB244FCF208E850<br />\n         1A07D8D6DDC7E623E71205074A05CEA2<br />\n         79C8E8B7DE36539FFC4B2B5825305324<br />\n         06CBB1CC51156C6D465F14829453DD68<br />\n         ED1A1008190A5D1654D138EB8FD1154A</p>\n<p>DigiNotar has not provided us with a copy of any of the certificates that they issued.  We are not sure that they have copies nor if they are willing to disclose any copies they may or may not have. This point is extremely disconcerting as the CRL/OCSP revocation process is essentially worthless. Mere serial numbers are simply not enough in some cases &mdash; especially when a full list of all likely compromised serial numbers has not been disclosed as happens to currently be the case.</p>\n<p>To the best of our knowledge and by analyzing the CRLs for DigiNotar, we do not believe that any of the fraudulently issued '*.torproject.org' certificates have been revoked at the time of this writing. It may be the case that they are simply not in the business of revoking certificates after they have expired. There is no evidence to support revocation during the time that these certificates were perfectly valid.</p>\n<p>I believe that you can clearly see the <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/rqwnJvn4\" rel=\"nofollow\">MITM attack in action</a> around the tenth hop of <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/traceroutes-inside-iran.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">this traceroute</a> thanks to an anonymous person in Iran:</p>\n<p>  1     3 ms    14 ms     2 ms  192.168.1.1<br />\n  2    67 ms    67 ms    65 ms  91.99.***.***.parsonline.net [91.99.***.***]<br />\n  3    65 ms    67 ms    93 ms  10.220.1.2<br />\n  4    67 ms    72 ms    66 ms  2.180.2.1<br />\n  5    66 ms    64 ms    64 ms  217.219.64.115<br />\n############### [ MORE Nodes ] #################<br />\n  6   451 ms   195 ms   154 ms  78.38.245.6<br />\n  7   626 ms   231 ms    88 ms  78.38.245.5<br />\n  8    93 ms    91 ms    96 ms  78.38.244.242<br />\n  9    88 ms    94 ms   120 ms  78.38.244.241<br />\n################### [ MORE ] ###################<br />\n 10    88 ms    88 ms    88 ms  10.10.53.33 ####DIfferent IP (0.0.0.33)</p>\n<p>#### [ OUT OF IRAN ] ####<br />\n 11   340 ms     *        *     pos3-1.palermo5.pal.seabone.net [195.22.198.77]</p>\n<p>To quote someone I respect greatly: \"That's not dodgy at all!\"</p>\n<p>Early statements By DigiNotar translated <a href=\"http://pastebin.com/JTpA1tJ6\" rel=\"nofollow\">by</a> <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/translation-of-press-release.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">someone</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/rop_g/status/108643861697531904\" rel=\"nofollow\">mentioned by a friendly Dutch man</a> lead us to believe that DigiNotar and their parent company are in damage-control mode. It would be unsurprising to hear that the Dutch Government is similarly in the dark about the scope of the compromise, as it appears DigiNotar does not control a canonical list for all certificates issued.  While some Browser vendors have received a list, I do not have confidence that this list actually contains all malicious certificates that have been issued: rather it appears to be a subset that did not even include the Google certificate that was being used in the wild.  We hope that DigiNotar will fully disclose whatever information they have and explain what information they honestly lack.</p>\n<p><strong>The defense</strong></p>\n<p>Modern versions of Chrome (13) were able to <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/gmail_certificate_error.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">prevent MITM attacks</a> against most, if not all of the Google sites where they had <a href=\"http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/05/04/pinning.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">certificate pinning</a> and where <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security\" rel=\"nofollow\">HSTS was enabled</a>. Google has also <a href=\"http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2011/08/update-on-attempted-man-in-middle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced the attacks</a> and updated information about it. Additionally, they have <a href=\"http://codereview.chromium.org/7795014\" rel=\"nofollow\">distrusted DigiNotar in Chrome</a>.</p>\n<p>We've sent a request to Google that they enable HSTS and pin certificates for some of the critical Tor sites and that <a href=\"http://codereview.chromium.org/7818002\" rel=\"nofollow\">patch</a> <a href=\"http://codereview.chromium.org/7818002/patch/1/3\" rel=\"nofollow\">is</a> <a href=\"http://codereview.chromium.org/7818002/patch/1/2\" rel=\"nofollow\">pending</a>. Google has been very good about all of this and I can't thank them enough for their help.</p>\n<p>As it stands, Chrome appears to have shipped a fix that distrusts DigiNotar and it appears to treat <a href=\"http://codereview.chromium.org/7791032/diff/2001/net/base/x509_certificate.cc\" rel=\"nofollow\">hundreds of certificates</a> as if they are specifically known to be malicious or hostile. Mozilla and others have shipped a fix as well. Sadly, it appears that the Dutch Government asked various browser vendors to create an exemption for certain trust chains as some kind of compromise. However, we were not party to any of the discussions, and we don't understand the core concerns for such a compromise. We're not willing to take a leap of faith for a Certificate Authority that did not contact us when they first noticed this problem.  Right now, if we found a DigiNotar-issued certificate certifying that water was wet, we wouldn't believe it without checking for ourselves. Twice.</p>\n<p>We have <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/commit/0be3b043afa0e54d207f603a3bf3716f6165caa1\" rel=\"nofollow\">proactively given</a> DigiNotar an \"Internet Death Sentence\" in the Tor Browser. The direct impact of removing DigiNotar should be on the order of around seven hundred certificates according to some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/nocombat/status/108951156377661441\" rel=\"nofollow\">cursory queries</a> run against the EFF's <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/observatory\" rel=\"nofollow\">SSL Observatory</a>. I believe that the number of certificates revoked is nearing parity with the number of possibly legitimate still-valid certificates issued by DigiNotar. That's a sad state of affairs.</p>\n<p>We do not currently have evidence of any tampering with Tor downloads, but we're looking.  If an attacker can successfully perform a MITM attack, there is nothing to prevent them from giving you a bogus package instead of the software you were actually looking for &mdash; if you're not checking package signatures, there's no easy way to tell good software from bad.</p>\n<p><strong>What you should do</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First of all, upgrade your browser(s).</strong> See <a href=\"http://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">this blog post</a> announcing the new Tor Browser Bundles with Firefox 6.</p>\n<p>Note that verifying the signatures on Tor packages prevents attackers like this from causing you to install a possibly backdoored version of Tor. You should always verify the signature of any software you download. We encourage you to <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en\" rel=\"nofollow\">learn more about secure signature verification</a>.</p>\n<p>If you have downloaded copies of any Tor software in the past few months, and you did it over any network that you don't trust, please help us check to see whether there was any attempt to alter them. We don't expect you'll find anything, but if you do, we really want to know about it. In any case, it will be good practice for checking signatures.</p>\n<p>If you have any information about certificates that you believe to be false, please do send us the certificates and we'll take a look.</p>\n<p>The Certificate Authority system as it stands today is a house of cards and we're witnessing in public what many have known for years in private. The entire system is soaked in petrol and waiting for a light. There are some new directions for trust in the works such as <a href=\"http://convergence.io/details.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Convergence</a> and various ways to do <a href=\"http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/06/16/dnssecchrome.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">DNSSEC authenticated HTTPS</a> as well as other hacks. Still, nothing is set in stone or standardized and this is why we need to remain vigilant. We're hoping to detect these kinds of attacks in the future with our <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/HTTPSEverywhere/SSLObservatorySubmission\" rel=\"nofollow\">distributed SSL Observatory</a> and we hope that you'll join us.</p>\n<p>I'd like to end on a <a href=\"http://www.crypto.com/blog/spycerts/\" rel=\"nofollow\">positive note</a> and quote a personal hero and friend, Matt Blaze: \"A decade ago, I observed that commercial certificate authorities protect you from anyone from whom they are unwilling to take money. That turns out to be wrong; they don't even do that much.\"</p>"

It seems that they're doing a great job keeping on top of things and doing the job that DigiNotar should've done in July. They sent a spreadsheet with a list of 531 entries on the currently known bad DigiNotar related certificates.</p>\n<p>The list isn't pretty and I've decided that in the interest of defenders everywhere without special connections, I'm going to disclose it. The people that I have spoken with in the Dutch Government agree with this course of action.</p>\n<p>This disclosure will absolutely not help any attacker as it does not contain the raw certificates; it is merely metadata about the certificates that were issued. It includes who we should not trust in the future going forward and it shows what is missing at the moment. This is an incomplete list because DigiNotar's audit trail is incomplete.</p>\n<p>This is the list of CA roots that should probably never be trusted again:</p>\n<p> DigiNotar Cyber CA<br />\n DigiNotar Extended Validation CA<br />\n DigiNotar Public CA 2025<br />\n DigiNotar Public CA - G2<br />\n Koninklijke Notariele Beroepsorganisatie CA<br />\n Stichting TTP Infos CA</p>\n<p>The most egregious certs issued were for *.*.com and *.*.org while certificates for Windows Update and certificates for other hosts are of limited harm by comparison. The attackers also issued certificates in the names of other certificate authorities such as \"VeriSign Root CA\" and \"Thawte Root CA\" as we witnessed with <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/detecting-certificate-authority-compromises-and-web-browser-collusion\" rel=\"nofollow\">ComodoGate</a>, although we cannot determine whether they succeeded in creating any intermediate CA certs. That's really saying something about the amount of damage a single compromised CA might inflict with poor security practices and regular internet luck.</p>\n<p>Of particular note is this certificate:<br />\nCN=*.RamzShekaneBozorg.com,SN=PK000229200006593,OU=Sare Toro Ham Mishkanam,L=Tehran,O=Hameye Ramzaro Mishkanam,C=IR</p>\n<p>The text here appears to be be an entry like any other but it is infact a calling card from a Farsi speaker. RamzShekaneBozorg.com is not a valid domain as of this writing.</p>\n<p>Thanks to an anonymous Farsi speaker, I now understand that the above certificate is actually a comment to anyone who bothers to read between the lines:<br />\n\"RamzShekaneBozorg\" is \"great cracker\"<br />\n\"Hameyeh Ramzaro Mishkanam\" translates to \"I will crack all encryption\"<br />\n\"Sare Toro Ham Mishkanam\" translates to \"i hate/break your head\"</p>\n<p>Without any further delay, I've uploaded  <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/rogue-certs-2011-09-04.xlsx\" rel=\"nofollow\">the original spreadsheet</a> and  <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/rogue-certs-2011-09-04.csv\" rel=\"nofollow\">a CSV text file</a> for people who don't trust spreadsheets. The information contained in both files should be the same. Hopefully this information will help people to mitigate certain harm from the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it\" rel=\"nofollow\">DigiNotar Debacle</a>.</p>"

    "content": "<p><b>Updated 09/05/2011</b>: Add link to actual <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob/maint-2.2:/src/current-patches/0006-Randomize-HTTP-pipeline-order-and-depth.patch\">implementation patch</a> on gitweb<br />\n<br></p>\n<p>Website fingerprinting is the act of recognizing web traffic through surveillance despite the use of encryption or anonymizing software. The general idea is to leverage the fact that many web sites have specific fixed request patterns and response byte counts that are known beforehand. This information can be used to recognize your web traffic despite attempts at encryption or tunneling. Websites that have an abundance of static content and a fixed request structure tend to be  vulnerable to this type of surveillance. Unfortunately, there is enough static content on most websites for this to be the case.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://guh.nu/projects/ta/safeweb/safeweb.pdf\">Early work</a> was quick to determine that simple packet-based encryption schemes (such as wireless and/or VPN encryption) were insufficient to prevent recognition of traffic patterns created by popular websites in the encrypted stream. Later, a <a href=\"http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/119060/WebAppSideChannel-final.pdf\">small-scale study</a> determined that a lot of information could be extracted from HTTPS streams using these same approaches against specific websites.</p>\n<p>Despite these early results, whenever researchers tried naively applying these techniques to Tor-like systems, they failed to come up with publishable results (meaning the attack did not work against Tor), due largely to the fixed 512 byte cell size, as well as the multiplexing of Tor client traffic over a single TLS connection.</p>\n<p>However, last month, a group of researchers <a href=\"http://lorre.uni.lu/~andriy/papers/acmccs-wpes11-fingerprinting.pdf\">succeeded in performing this attack</a> where the others had failed. Their success hinged largely on their use of a simplified yet well-chosen feature set for training their classifiers. Where other researchers simply dumped packet sizes and timings into their classifiers and unsurprisingly got poor results against Tor traffic, this group extracted the time, quantity and direction of traffic, and discarded irrelevant control information such as TCP ACKs.</p>\n<p>While the research methodology of the attack side of their work is particularly exemplary (certainly the most thorough study in website fingerprinting to date),  their results are still likely insufficient to deploy against the network and expect to catch people engaging in single visits of forbidden websites. For such a use case, even their relatively low false positive rate is going to cause a lot of issues when deployed against large quantities of traffic. Concurrent use of multiple AJAX-enabled websites and/or other applications will also frustrate an attacker. Even without concurrent activity, their \"open-world\" experiment (the most realistic scenario for dragnet surveillance of Tor traffic) shows true positive accuracy of around 55%.</p>\n<p>However, repeated observations over long periods of time are likely sufficient to develop certainty. It is also possible that extracting actual application data lengths from Tor TLS headers would add additional accuracy.</p>\n<p>Hence, this is a rather nasty attack. It is basically a one-ended version of the age-old end-to-end correlation attack (where an adversary attempts to observe both the entrance to the network and the exits to correlate traffic flows). With the website fingerprinting attack, the adversary only needs to observe a single entry (a bridge, a guard node, or a regional firewall) of the network to begin gathering information about users who use that entry point.</p>\n<p>However, because the attack is only one-ended, many defenses that would be useless against the full end-to-end attack can be considered. In the countermeasures section of their paper, the researchers point out that a Firefox addon that simply performs background HTTP requests concurrent to normal user activity was enough to foil their classifier.</p>\n<p>We disagree with the background fetch approach because it seems that a slightly more sophisticated attack would train a separate classifier to recognize the background cover traffic and then subtract it before attempting to classify the remainder. In the face of this concern, it seems that the background request defense is not worth the additional network load until it can be further studied in detail.</p>\n<p>Instead, we are deploying an <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3914\">experimental defense</a> in <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-5\">today's Tor Browser Bundle release</a> that is specifically designed to reduce the information available for feature extraction without adding overhead. The defense is to enable <a href=\"https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/HTTP_pipelining\">HTTP pipelining</a>, and to randomize the pipeline size as well as the order of requests. The <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob/maint-2.2:/src/current-patches/0006-Randomize-HTTP-pipeline-order-and-depth.patch\">source code to the implementation</a> can be viewed on gitweb.</p>\n<p>Since normal, non-randomized pipelining is still off by default to this day in Firefox, we are assuming that the published attack results are against serialized request/response behavior, which provides significantly more feature information to the attacker. In particular, we believe a randomized pipeline will eliminate or reduce the utility of the 'Size Marker', 'Number Marker', 'Number of Packets', and 'Occurring Packet Sizes' features on sites that support pipelining, due to the batching of requests and responses of arbitrary sizes. More generally, the randomized pipeline should obscure the request vs response size and request ordering information available to the classifier. </p>\n<p>Our hope is that the randomized pipeline defense will therefore increase the duration of observation required to establish certainty that a site is being visited, by lowering the true positive rate and/or raising the false positive rate beyond what the researchers observed.</p>\n<p>We do not expect this defense to be foolproof. We create it as a prototype, and request that future research papers do not treat the defense as if it were the final solution against website fingerprinting of Tor traffic. In particular, not all websites support pipelining (in fact, an unknown number may deliberately disable it to reduce load), and even those that do will still leak the initial response size as well as the total response size to the attacker. Pipelining may also be disabled by malicious or simply misconfigured exits.</p>\n<p>However, the defense could also be improved. We did not attempt to determine the optimal pipeline size or distribution, and are relying on the research community to tweak these parameters as they evaluate the defense.</p>\n<p>We could also take more extreme measures, such as building pipelining support into Tor exit nodes. Perhaps better still, we could deploy an <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/ideas/xxx-using-spdy.txt\">HTTP to SPDY translation service at exits</a>. The more efficient request bundling of <a href=\"http://dev.chromium.org/spdy\">SPDY</a> would likely obscure request vs response size information yet further. However, as these translations are potentially fragile as well as labor-intensive to implement and deploy, we are unlikely to take these measures without further feedback from and study by the research community.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, or perhaps additionally, defenses could be deployed at the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/protocol-spec.txt\">obfsproxy plugin layer</a>. Defenses there would not help against an adversary at the bridge or guard node, but would help against regional firewalls.</p>\n<p>We would love to hear feedback from the research community about these approaches, and look forward to hearing more results of future attack and defense work along these and other avenues.</p>"

    "content": "<p><strong>The short version: Tor relays and bridges should upgrade to Tor 0.2.2.33 or Tor 0.2.3.4-alpha so users in Iran can reach them again.</strong></p>\n<p>Yesterday morning (in our timezones &mdash; that evening, in Iran), Iran added a filter rule to their border routers that recognized Tor traffic and blocked it. Thanks to help from a variety of friends around the world, we quickly discovered how they were blocking it and released a <a href=\"http://archives.seul.org/tor/talk/Sep-2011/msg00187.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">new version of Tor</a> that isn't blocked. Fortunately, the fix is on the relay side: that means once enough <a href=\"https://torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay\" rel=\"nofollow\">relays</a> and <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridges</a> upgrade, the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=direct-users&amp;start=2011-06-16&amp;end=2011-09-14&amp;country=ir&amp;dpi=72#direct-users\" rel=\"nofollow\">many tens of thousands of Tor users in Iran</a> will resume being able to reach the Tor network, without needing to change their software.</p>\n<p>How did the filter work technically? Tor tries to make its traffic look like a web browser talking to an https web server, but if you look carefully enough you can tell some differences. In this case, the characteristic of Tor's SSL handshake they looked at was the expiry time for our SSL session certificates: we rotate the session certificates every two hours, whereas normal SSL certificates you get from a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/detecting-certificate-authority-compromises-and-web-browser-collusion\" rel=\"nofollow\">certificate</a> <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it\" rel=\"nofollow\">authority</a> typically last a year or more. The fix was to simply write a larger expiration time on the certificates, so our certs have <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/observatory\" rel=\"nofollow\">more plausible</a> expiry times.</p>\n<p>There are plenty of interesting discussion points from the research angle around how this arms race should be played. We're working on <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/176-revising-handshake.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">medium</a> <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/179-TLS-cert-and-parameter-normalization.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">term</a> and <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/180-pluggable-transport.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">longer term</a> solutions, but in the short term, there are other ways to filter Tor traffic like the one Iran used. Should we fix them all preemptively, meaning the next time they block us it will be through some more complex mechanism that's harder to figure out? Or should we leave things as they are, knowing there will be more blocking events but also knowing that we can solve them easily? Given that their last blocking attempt was in <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/update-internet-censorship-iran\" rel=\"nofollow\">January 2011</a>, I think it's smartest to collect some more data points first.</p>\n<p>It's too early to have cool graphs showing a drop in users and then the users coming back a day or so later. I'll plan to add these graphs once things play out more. [Update: <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=direct-users&amp;start=2011-07-01&amp;end=2011-09-18&amp;country=ir&amp;events=on&amp;dpi=72#direct-users\" rel=\"nofollow\">here is the graph as of Sept 16</a>]</p>"

Last but not least, tails-greeter is actually only 3rd consumer of GDM's greeter API besides GDM's own greeter and gdm-commmunity-greeter (<a href=\"https://launchpad.net/gdm-commmunity-greeter\" title=\"https://launchpad.net/gdm-commmunity-greeter\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://launchpad.net/gdm-commmunity-greeter</a>). Because of that many things about the interaction with GDM are not very well documented.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, with the help from community, tails-greeter is ready to perform its duties: request language &amp; layout information, set password for user and perform login. The project is rather easy to understand (581 source lines of code according to sloccount) so it can (and probably will) be extended in the future to request more information to adapt TAILS for user needs before login.</p>\n<p>There are several things which could be improved, both user-visible (data representation) and internal (login procedure). I plan to stay in touch with the community to help to make tails-greeter ready for the inclusion into TAILS.</p>"

Let's talk about how it works, and how it relates to the Tor protocol.</p>\n<p>Short version: Don't panic. The Tor software itself is just fine, and the free-software browser vendors look like they're responding well and quickly.  I'll be talking about why Tor is fine; I'll bet that the TBB folks will have more to say about browsers sometime soon.</p>\n<p>There is some discussion of the attack and responses to it out there already, written by <a href=\"http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2011/09/man-in-the-midd_4.html\">seriously smart cryptographers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/09/23/chromeandbeast.html\">high-test browser security people</a>.  But I haven't seen anything out there yet that tries to explain what's going on for people who don't know TLS internals and CBC basics.</p>\n<p>So I'll do my best.  This blog post also assumes that <em>I</em> understand the attack.  Please bear with me if I'm wrong about that.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the authors of the paper for letting me read it and show it to other Tor devs.  Thanks also to Ralf-Philipp Weinmann for helping me figure the analysis out.</p>\n<h2>The attack</h2>\n<h3>How the attack works: Basic background</h3>\n<p>This writeup assumes that you know a little bit of computer stuff, and you know how xor works.</p>\n<p>Let's talk about block ciphers, for starters.  A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher\">block cipher</a> is a cryptographic tool that encrypts a small chunk of plaintext data into a same-sized chunk of encrypted data, based on a secret key.</p>\n<p>In practice, you want to encrypt more than just one chunk of data with your block cipher at a time.  What do you do if you have a block cipher with a 16-byte block (like AES), when you need to encrypt a 256-byte message? When most folks first consider this problem, they say something like \"Just split the message into 16-byte chunks, and encrypt each one of those.\"  That's an old idea (it's called ECB, or \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Electronic_codebook_.28ECB.29\">electronic codebook</a>\"), but it has some serious problems.  Most significantly, if the same 16-byte block appears multiple times in the plaintext, the ciphertext will also have identical blocks in the same position.  The Wikipedia link above has a cute demonstration of this.</p>\n<p>Okay, so nobody reasonable uses ECB.  Some people, though, do use a mode called CBC, or \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29\">Cipher Block Chaining</a>.\"  With CBC, when you want to encrypt a message, you start your ciphertext message with a single extra random block, or IV (\"initialization vector\").  Now, when you go to encrypt each plaintext block to get its ciphertext block, you first <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xor\">xor</a> the plaintext with the previous ciphertext.    (So you xor the IV with the first plaintext block, encrypt that, and output it.  Then you xor that ciphertext block with the second plaintext block, encrypt that, output it, and so on.  The Wikipedia page has pretty good examples and illustrations here too.)</p>\n<p>TLS and its earlier incarnation, SSL, are the encryption protocols that many applications, including Tor, use to send streams of encrypted data. They use CBC mode for most of their block ciphers.    Unfortunately, before TLS version 1.1, they made a bad mistake.  Instead of using a new random IV for every TLS message they sent, they used the ciphertext of the last block of the last message as the IV for the next message.</p>\n<p>Here's why that's bad.  The IV is not just supposed to be random-looking; it also needs to be something that an attacker cannot predict.  If I know that you are going to use IV x for your next message, and I can trick you into sending a message that starts with a plaintext block of [(NOT x) xor y], then you will encrypt y for me.</p>\n<p>That doesn't sound too bad.  But <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/openssl-dev@openssl.org/msg10664.html\">Wei Dai</a> and <a href=\"http://eprint.iacr.org/2004/111.pdf\">Gregory V. Bard</a> both found ways to exploit this to learn whether a given ciphertext block corresponds to a given plaintext.  The attacker makes the user encrypt C' xor p, where p is the guessed plaintext and C' is the ciphertext block right before where the attacker thinks that plaintext was.  If the attacker guessed right, then the user's SSL implementation outputs the same ciphertext as it did when it first encrypted that block.</p>\n<p>And even <b>that</b> doesn't sound too bad, even in retrospect.  In order to mount this attack, an adversary would need to be watching your internet connection, and be able to force you to start your next TLS record with a given string of his choice, and be able to guess something sensitive that you said earlier, and guess which part of your TLS stream might have corresponded to it.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, crypto people implemented workarounds.  Better safe than sorry!  In version 1.1 of the TLS protocol, every record gets a fresh IV, so the attacker can't know the IV of the next message in advance.  And OpenSSL implemented a fix where, whenever they're about to send a TLS record, they send an empty TLS record immediately before, and then send the record with the message in it.  The empty TLS record is enough to make the CBC state change, effectively giving the real message a new IV that the attacker can't predict.</p>\n<p>These fixes haven't gotten very far in the web world, though.  TLS 1.1 isn't widely implemented or deployed, even though the standard has been out since 2006.  And<br />\nOpenSSL's \"empty record\" trick turns out to break some non-conformant SSL implementations, so lots of folks turn it off.  (The OpenSSL manual page for the option in question even says that \"it is usually safe\" to do so.)</p>\n<p>I suppose that, at the time, this seemed pretty reasonable.  Guessing a plaintext is hard: there are something like 3.4 x 10^38 possible values.  But as they say, attacks only get better.</p>\n<h3>How the attack works: What's new as of today</h3>\n<p>Juliano Rizzo and Thai Duong have two contributions, as I see it.  (And please correct me if I'm getting this wrong; I have not read the literature closely!)  First, they came up with a scenario to implement a pretty clever variation of Dai's original attack.  </p>\n<p>Here's a simplified version, not exactly as Rizzo and Duong present it.   Let's suppose that, for some reason, the user has a secret (like a web cookie) that they send in every TLS record.  And let's assume also that the attacker can trick the user into inserting any number of characters in their plaintext at the start of the record right before the secret.  So the plaintext for every record is \"Evil | Secret\", where Evil is what the attacker chooses, and Secret is the secret message.  Finally, let's suppose that the attacker can make the user send as many records as he wants.</p>\n<p>The ability to decide where block boundaries fall turns out to be a big deal. Let's suppose that instead of filling up a full plaintext block with 16 bytes of Evil, the attacker only fills up 15 bytes... so the block will have 15 bytes the attacker controls, and one byte of the secret.</p>\n<p>Whoops!  There are only 256 possible values for a single byte, so the attacker can guess each one in turn, and use the older guess-checking attack to see if he guessed right.  And once the attacker knows the first byte, he starts sending records with 14 attacker-controlled bytes, one byte that he knows (because he made a bunch of guesses and used the older attack to confirm which was right), and one byte that he doesn't.  Again, this block has only 256 possible values, and so guessing each one in turn is efficient.</p>\n<p>They then show how to extend this to cases where the attacker doesn't actually control the start of the block, but happens to know (or is able to guess) it, and make other extensions to the attack.</p>\n<p>The second neat facet of Duong and Rizzo's work is that they actually found some ways to make this attack work against web browsers.  That's no mean feat!  You need to find a way to trick a web client into sending requests where you control enough of the right parts of them to mount this attack, and you need to be able to do it repeatedly.  It seems to have taken a lot of HTTP hackery, but it seems they managed to do it. There's more detailed information here at <a href=\"http://www.educatedguesswork.org/2011/09/security_impact_of_the_rizzodu.html\">Eric Rescorla's blog</a>, and of course once Juliano and Thai have their paper out, there will be even more to goggle at.  This is really clever stuff IMO.</p>\n<p>[Disclaimer: Again, I may have made mistakes above; if so, I will correct it when I wake up in the morning, or sooner.  Please double-check me if you know this work better than I do.]</p>\n<h2>So, does this attack work on Tor?</h2>\n<p>Nope.</p>\n<p>Tor uses OpenSSL's \"empty fragment\" feature, which inserts a single empty TLS record before every record it sends.  This effectively randomizes the IV of the actual records, like a low-budget TLS 1.1.  So the attack is simply stopped.</p>\n<p>This feature has been in OpenSSL since 0.9.6d: see item 2 in <a href=\"http://www.openssl.org/~bodo/tls-cbc.txt\">Bodo Müller's good old CBC writeup</a> for full details on how it works.  It makes our SSL incompatible with some standards-non-compliant TLS implementations... but we don't really care there, since all of the TLS implementations that connect to the Tor network are OpenSSL, or are compatible with it.</p>\n<p>Tor requires OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later, and has since 0.2.0.10-alpha.  Amusingly, we were considering dropping our use of the empty fragment feature as \"probably unnecessary\" in 2008, but we never got around to it.  I sure don't think we'll be doing that now!</p>\n<p>Now, it's possible that clients we didn't write might be using other TLS implementations, but the opportunity for plaintext injection on client->relay links is much lower than on relay->relay links; see below.  As far as I know, there are no Tor server implementations compatible with the current network other than ours.</p>\n<p>Also, this only goes for the Tor software itself.  Applications that use TLS need to watch out.  Please install patches, and look for new releases if any are coming out soon.</p>\n<h2>But what if...</h2>\n<h3>Okay, but would it work if we didn't use OpenSSL's empty-fragment trick?</h3>\n<p>For fun, what would our situation be if we weren't using openssl's empty fragment trick?</p>\n<p>I'm going to diverge into Tor protocol geekery here.  <strong>All of the next several sections are probably irrelevant</strong>, since the OpenSSL trick above protects Tor's TLS usage already.</strong>  I'm just into analyzing stuff sometimes... and at the time I originally wrote this analysis, we didn't have confirmation about whether the OpenSSL empty-record trick would help or not.</p>\n<p>This part will probably be a little harder to follow, and will require some knowledge of Tor internals.  You can find all of our documents and specifications online at our handy <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/documentation.html#DesignDoc\">documentation page</a> if you've got some free time and you want to come up to speed.</p>\n<p>The attack scenario that makes sense is for an attacker to be trying to decrypt stuff sent from one Tor node to another, or between a Tor node and a client.  The attacker is not one of the parties on the TLS link, obviously: if they were, they'd already know the plaintext and would not need to decrypt it.</p>\n<p>First, let's make some assumptions to make things as easy for the attacker as possible.  Let's assume that the attacker can trivially inject chosen plaintext, and can have the TLS records carve up the plaintext stream anywhere he wants.</p>\n<p>(Are those assumptions reasonable?  Well, it's easy to inject plaintext on a relay->relay link: sending a node an EXTEND cell will make it send any CREATE cell body that you choose, and if you have built a circuit through a node, you can cause a RELAY cell on that node to have nearly any body you want, since the body is encrypted/decrypted in counter mode.  I don't see an obvious way to make a node send a chosen plaintext to a client or make a client send a chosen plaintext to a node, but let's pretend that it's easy to do that too.</p>\n<p>The second assumption, about how it's easy to make the boundaries of TLS records fall wherever you want, is likely to be more contentious; see \"More challenges for the attacker\" below.)</p>\n<p>Also let's assume that on the targeted link, traffic for only one client is sent.  An active attacker might arrange this through a trickle attack or something.</p>\n<p>I am assuming that the attacker is observing ciphertext at a targeted node or client, but not at two targeted places that allow him to see the same traffic enter and leave the network: by our threat model, any attacker who can observe two points on a circuit is assumed to win via traffic correlation attacks.</p>\n<p>I am going to argue that even then, the earlier attack doesn't get the attacker anything, and the preconditions for the Duong/Rizzo attack don't exist.</p>\n<h3>CLAIM 1: The earlier (Dai/Bard) attacks don't get the attacker anything against the Tor protocol</h3>\n<p>There are no interesting guessable plaintexts sent by a well-behaved client or node[*] on a Tor TLS link: all are either random, nearly random, or boring from an attacker's POV.</p>\n<p>[*] What if a node or client is hostile?  Then it might as well just publish its plaintext straight to the attacker.</p>\n<p>Argument: CREATE cell bodies contain hybrid-encrypted stuff that (except for its first bit) should be indistinguishable from random bits, or pretty close to indistinguishable from random bits. CREATED cell bodies have a DH public key and a hash: also close to indistinguishable from random.  CREATE_FAST cell bodies *are* randomly generated, and CREATED_FAST cell bodies have a random value and a hash.</p>\n<p>RELAY and RELAY_EARLY cell bodies are encrypted with at least one layer of AES_CTR, so they shouldn't be distinguishable from random bits either.</p>\n<p>DESTROY, PADDING, NETINFO, and VERSIONS cells do not have interesting bodies.  DESTROY and PADDING bodies are either 0s or random bytes, and NETINFO and VERSIONS provide only trivial information that you can learn just by connecting to a node (the time of day, its addresses, and which versions of the Tor link protocol it speaks).</p>\n<p>That's cell bodies.  What about their headers?  A Tor cell's header has a command and a circuit ID that take up only 3 bytes.  Learning the command doesn't tell you anything you couldn't notice by observing the encrypted link in the first place and doing a little traffic analysis.  The link-local 2-byte circuit ID is random, and not<br />\ninteresting per se, but possibly interesting if you could use it to demultiplex traffic sent over multiple circuits.  I'll discuss that more below at the end of the next section.</p>\n<h3>CLAIM 2: You can't do the Duong/Rizzo attack against the Tor protocol either</h3>\n<p>The attack requires that some piece of sensitive information M that you want to guess be re-sent repeatedly after the attacker's chosen plaintext.  That is, it isn't enough to get the target to send one TLS record containing (evil | M) -- you need to get it to send a bunch of (evil | M) records with the same M to learn much about M.</p>\n<p>But in Tor's link protocol, nothing sensitive is sent more than once. Tor does not retry the same CREATE or CREATE_FAST cells, or re-send CREATED or CREATED_FAST cells.  RELAY cells are encrypted with at least one layer of AES_CTR, and no RELAY cell body is sent more than once.  (The same applies to RELAY_EARLY.)</p>\n<p>PADDING cells have no interesting content to learn.  VERSIONS and NETINFO cells are sent only at the start of the TLS connection (and their contents are boring too).</p>\n<p>What about the cell headers?  They contain a command and a circuit ID.  If a node is working normally, you can already predict that most of the commands will be RELAY.  You can't predict that any given circuit's cells will be sent reliably after yours, so you can't be sure that you'll see the same circuitID over and over... unless if you've done a trickle attack, in which case you already know that all the cells you're seeing are coming from the same place; or if you've lucked out and one circuit is way louder than all the others, but you would already learn that from watching the node's network.  So I think that anything that is sent frequently enough to be decryptable with this method is not in fact worth decrypting.  But see the next section.</p>\n<h3>Hey, what if I'm wrong about those cell headers?</h3>\n<p>Let's pretend that I flubbed the analyis above, and that the attacker can read the command and circuitID for every cell on a link.  All this allows the attacker to do is to demultiplex the circuits on the link, and better separate the traffic pattern flows that the link is multiplexing for different clients... but the attacker can't really<br />\nuse this info unless the attacker can correlate it with a flow somewhere else.  This requires that the attacker be watching the same traffic at two points.  But if the attacker can do that, the attacker can already (we assume) do a passive correlation attack and win.</p>\n<h3>And what if I'm wrong entirely?</h3>\n<p>Now let's imagine that I am totally wrong, and TLS is completely broken, providing no confidentiality whatsoever?  (Assume that it's still providing authenticity.)</p>\n<p>Of course, this is a <em>really unlikely scenario</em>, but it's neat to speculate.</p>\n<p>The attacker can remove at most one layer of encryption from RELAY cells in this case, because every hop of a circuit (except sometimes the first) is created with a one-way-authenticated Diffie-Hellman handshake.  (The first hop may be created with a CREATE_FAST handshake, which is not remotely secure against an attacker who can see the plaintext inside the TLS stream.) Anonymized RELAY traffic is encrypted in AES_CTR mode with keys based on at least one CREATE handshake, so the attacker can't beat it.  Non-anonymized RELAY traffic (that is, tunneled directory connections) don't contain sensitive requests or information.</p>\n<p>So if the attacker can use this attack to completely decrypt TLS at a single hop on a Tor circuit, they still don't win.  (All they can do is demultiplex circuits, about which see above.)  And for them to do this attack at multiple points on the circuit, they would have to observe those points, in which case they're already winning according to our threat model.</p>\n<h3>More challenges for the attacker</h3>\n<p>It's actually even a little harder to do this attack against Tor than I've suggested.</p>\n<p>First, consider bandwidth-shaping: If a node or a link is near its bandwidth limit, it will split cells in order to stay under that limit.</p>\n<p>Also, on a busy node, you can't really send a cell and expect it to get decrypted and put into the next output record on a given link: there are likely to be other circuits queueing other cells for that link, and by the time your cell is sent, it's likely that they'll have sent stuff too.  You can get increased priority by making a very quiet<br />\ncircuit, though.</p>\n<p>Finally, I don't actually think it's possible to cause chosen plaintext to appear on a client->server link.</p>\n<h3>Recommendations</h3>\n<p>We dodged an interesting bullet on this one: part of it was luck, and part of it was a redundant protocol design.  Nevertheless, let's \"close the barn doors,\" even though the horse is still tied up, chained down, and probably sedated too.</p>\n<p>First, as soon as OpenSSL 1.0.1 is out and stable, we should strongly suggest that people move to it.  (It provides TLS 1.1.)  We should probably build all of our packages to use it.  But sadly, we'll have to think about protocol fingerprinting issues there, in case nobody else jumps onto the TLS 1.1 bandwagon with us. :/</p>\n<p>We should include recommended use of the OpenSSL empty-record trick in our spec as a requirement or a strong recommendation.  I'll add a note to that effect.</p>\n<p>In future designs of replacements for the current RELAY and CREATE format, we should see if there are ways to prevent them from being used for chosen plaintext injection.  This might not be the last attack of its kind, after all.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we should put an upper bound on the circuit priority algorithm if we haven't already, so that no circuit can achieve more than a given amount of priority for being quiet, and so that you can't reliably know that your cell will be sent next on a link.  But that's pretty farfetched.</p>\n<h3>And in closing</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=longcat&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbm=isch\">longpost is loooooooong</a></p>\n<p>Thanks to everybody who followed along with me so far, thanks to Juliano and Thai for letting me read their paper ahead of time, and thanks to everybody who helped me write this up.

    "content": "<p>The Tor network is run by volunteers, and for the most part is entirely independent of the software development effort led by The Tor Project, Inc. While The Tor Project, Inc is a 501(c)3 non-profit that is <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en\" rel=\"nofollow\">happy to take donations</a> to create more and better software, up until recently there was no way for you to fund deployment of more relays to improve network capacity and performance, aside from running those relays yourself.</p>\n<p>We're happy to announce that both <a href=\"https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Tor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Noisebridge</a> and <a href=\"https://www.torservers.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">TorServers.net</a> are now able to take donations directly for the purpose of running high capacity Tor exit nodes.</p>\n<p>Noisebridge is a US 501(c)3 non-profit, which means that for US citizens, <a href=\"http://tor.noisebridge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">donations</a> are tax deductible. Torservers.net is a German non-profit organization whose <a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/donate.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">donations</a> are tax deductible for German citizens (and <a href=\"http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:62007J0318:EN:HTML\" rel=\"nofollow\">also potentially</a> for citizens of other EU member states).</p>\n<p>What are the pluses and minuses of donating as opposed to running your own relay? Glad you asked!</p>\n<p>While it is relatively easy and risk-free to run a middle relay or a bridge, running an exit can be tough. You have to seek out a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TheOnionRouter/GoodBadISPs\" rel=\"nofollow\">friendly ISP</a>, explain Tor to them, and then navigate a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tips-running-exit-node-minimal-harassment\" rel=\"nofollow\">laundry list of Internet bureaucracies</a> to ensure that when abuse happens, the burden of <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TheOnionRouter/TorAbuseTemplates\" rel=\"nofollow\">answering complaints</a> falls upon you and not your ISP.</p>\n<p>These barriers are all made easier the larger your budget is. On top of this, like most things, bandwidth is cheaper in bulk. But not just <a href=\"http://www.costco.com/Browse/Product.aspx?prodid=11487214\" rel=\"nofollow\">Costco cheaper</a>: exponential-growth cheaper, all the way up into the gigabit range (and perhaps beyond, but no one has run a Tor node on anything faster).</p>\n<p>At these scales, large exit nodes can pay as little as $1/mo per dedicated megabit/second. Sometimes less. This means that <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/subscriptions/business=treasurer%40noisebridge.net&amp;item_name=Noisebridge%20Tor%20Node%20Project&amp;cy_code=USD&amp;no_note=1&amp;no_shipping=1&amp;a3=30&amp;p3=1&amp;t3=M&amp;src=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">adding $30/mo</a> to the hosting budget of a large exit node can buy almost 40 times more full-duplex dedicated bandwidth than a similarly priced business upgrade to your home ADSL line would buy, and about 50 times more bandwidth than Amazon EC2 instances at the entry-level price of $0.08 per half-duplex gigabyte, not counting CPU costs. (<a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bridge</a> economics in terms of IP address space availability might still favor Amazon EC2, but that is a different discussion).</p>\n<p>The downside to donation is that network centralization can lead to a more fragile and a more observable network. If these nodes fail, the network will definitely feel the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/performance.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">performance</a> <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-September/021493.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">loss</a>. In terms of observability, fewer nodes also means that fewer points of surveillance are required to deanonymize users (though <a href=\"http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Sep-2008/msg00016.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">some argue</a> that more users will make such surveillance less reliable, no one has yet rigorously quantified that result against actual attacks).</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you are able to run a high capacity relay or exit yourself (or have access to cheap/free/<a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/master:/contrib/linux-tor-prio.sh\" rel=\"nofollow\">unused</a> bandwidth at your work/school), running your own relay is definitely preferred. If you are part of the Tor community and want to accept donations, we'd love to add you to our <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#RelayDonations\" rel=\"nofollow\">recommended donor list</a>. Please join us on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-relays\" rel=\"nofollow\">tor-relays mailing list</a> to discuss <a href=\"https://github.com/noisetor/\" rel=\"nofollow\">node configuration</a> and <a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/wiki/guides\" rel=\"nofollow\">setup</a>.</p>\n<p>However, if configuring and maintaining a high capacity relay is not for you, donating a portion of the monthly hosting budgets of either of these organizations is an excellent way to support anonymity, privacy, and censorship circumvention for very large numbers of people.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Jake, Arturo, and I went to <a href=\"http://arabloggers.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tunisia</a> Oct 3-7 to teach a bunch of bloggers from Arab countries about Tor and more generally about Internet security and privacy. The previous meetings were in Lebanon; it's amazing to reflect that the world has changed enough that <a href=\"http://samibengharbia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sami</a> can hold it in his home country now.</p>\n<p>The conference was one day of keynotes with lots of press attention, and then three days of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference\" rel=\"nofollow\">unconference</a>-style workshops. </p>\n<p>On the keynote day, Jake and Arturo did a talk on mobile privacy, pointing out the wide variety of ways that the telephone network is \"the best surveillance tool ever invented\". The highlight for the day was when Moez Chakchouk, the head of the Tunisian Internet Agency (ATI), did a talk explicitly stating that Tunisia had been using Smartfilter since 2002, that Smartfilter had been giving Tunisia discounts in exchange for beta-testing their products for other countries in the region like Saudi Arabia, and that it was time for Tunisia to stop wasting money on expensive filters that aren't good for the country anyway.</p>\n<p>We did a four-hour Tor training on the first workshop day. We covered what to look for in a circumvention or privacy tool (open source good, open design good, open analysis of security properties good, centralization bad). All the attendees left with a working Tor Browser Bundle install (well, all the attendees except the fellow with the ipad). We got many of them to install <a href=\"http://www.pidgin.im/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pidgin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OTR</a> as well, but ran into some demo bugs around the Jabber connect server config that derailed some users. I look forward to having the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-im-browser-bundle-discontinued-temporarily\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tor IM Browser Bundle</a> back in action now that we've fixed some Pidgin security bugs. </p>\n<p>We did a three-hour general security and privacy Q&amp;A on the second workshop day, covering topics like whether Skype is safe, how else can they do VoIP, how can they trust various software, a demo of what sniffing the network can show, iphone vs android vs blackberry, etc. It ended with a walk-through of how <em>*we*</em> keep our laptops secure, so people could see how far down the rabbit hole they can go.</p>\n<p>Syria and Israel seem to be the scariest adversaries in the area right now, in terms of oppression technology and willingness to use it. Or said another way, if you live in Syria or Palestine, you are especially screwed. We heard some really sad and disturbing stories; but those stories aren't mine to tell here.</p>\n<p>We helped to explain the implications of the 54 gigs of Bluecoat logs that got published from inside Syria, detailing URLs and the IP addresses that fetched them. (The IP addresses were scrubbed from the published version of the logs, but the URLs, user agents, timestamps, etc still contain quite sensitive info.)<br />\n<a href=\"http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/10/bluecoat-us-technology-surveilling-syrian-citizens-online/\" title=\"http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/10/bluecoat-us-technology-surveilling-syrian-citizens-online/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2011/10/10/bluecoat-us-technology...</a></p>\n<p>Perhaps most interesting in the Bluecoat logs is the evidence of Bluecoat devices phoning home to get updates. So much for Bluecoat's claims that they don't provide support to Syria. If the US government chose to enforce its existing laws against American companies selling surveillance tools to Syria, it would be a great step toward making Tor users safer in Syria right now: no doubt Syria has some smart people who can configure things locally, but it's way worse when Silicon Valley engineers provide new filter rules to detect protocols like Tor for no additional charge.</p>\n<p>The pervasiveness of video cameras and journalists at the meeting was surprising. I'm told the previous Arab blogger meeting was just a bunch of geeks sitting around their laptops talking about how to improve their countries and societies. Now that the Twitter Revolution is hot in the press, I guess all the Western media now want a piece of the action.</p>\n<p>On the third workshop day we learned that there was a <a href=\"http://info-tunisie.net/high-tech/actualite/tic/21955-tunisie--iptelecom-expo-2011-les-6-et-7-octobre\" rel=\"nofollow\">surveillance corporate expo</a> happening in the same hotel as the blogger meeting. We crashed it and collected some brochures. We also found a pair of students from a nearby university who had set up a booth to single-handedly try to offset the evil of the expo. They were part of a security student group at their university that had made a magazine that talked among other things about Tor, Tunisian filtering, etc. We gave them a big pile of Tor stickers.</p>\n<p>On our extra day after the workshops, we visited Moez at his Internet Agency and interviewed him for a few hours about the state of filtering in his country. He confirmed that they renewed their Smartfilter license until Sept 2012, and that they still filter \"the groups that want it\" (government and schools), but for technical reasons they have turned off the global filters (they broke and nobody has fixed them). We pointed out that since an external company operates their filters &mdash; including for their military &mdash; then that company not only has freedom to censor anything they want, but they also get to see every single request when deciding whether to censor it. Moez used the phrase \"national sovereignty\" when explaining why it isn't a great idea for Tunisia to outsource their filtering. Great point: it would be foolish to imagine that this external company isn't logging things for their own purposes, whether that's \"improving their product\" or something more sinister. As we keep seeing, collecting a large data set and then hoping to keep it secret never seems to work out.</p>\n<p>One of the points Jake kept hammering on throughout the week was \"if <em>*anything*</em> is being filtered, then you have to realize that they're surveilling <em>*everything*</em> in order to make those filtering decisions.\" The Syrian logs help to drive the point home but it seems like a lot of people haven't really internalized it yet. We still find people thinking of Tor solely as an \"anti-filter\" tool and not considering the surveillance angle.</p>\n<p>After the meeting with Moez, we went to visit one of the universities.  We talked to a few dozen students who were really excited to find us there &mdash; to the point that they quickly located a video camera and interviewed us on the spot. They brought us to their security class, and informed the professor that we would be speaking for the first half hour of it. We gave an impassioned plea for them to learn more about Tor and teach other people in their country how to be safe online. I think the group of students there could be really valuable for creating local technical Tor resources. As a bonus, the traditional path for a computer science graduate of this university is to go work at Tunisia Telecom, the monopoly telco that hosts the filtering boxes &amp;mdash the more we can influence the incoming generations, the more the change will grow.</p>"

    "content": "<p>There are two recent stories claiming the Tor network is compromised. It seems it is easier to get press than to publish research, work with us on the details, and propose solutions. Our comments here are based upon the same stories you are reading. We have no insider information.</p>\n<p>The first story has been around 'Freedom Hosting' and their hosting of child abuse materials as exposed by <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2011/10/anonymous-takes-down-darknet-child-porn-site-on-tor-network.ars\" >Anonymous Operation Darknet</a>. We're reading the press articles, pastebin urls, and talking to the same people as you. It appears 'Anonymous' cracked the Apache/PHP/MySQL setup at Freedom Hosting and published some, or all, of their users in the database. These sites happened to be hosted on a <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en\" >Tor hidden service</a>. Further, 'Anonymous' used a somewhat recent RAM-exhaustion denial of service attack on the 'Freedom Hosting' Apache server. It's a simple resource starvation attack that can be conducted over low bandwidth, low resource requirement connections to individual hosts. This isn't an attack on Tor, but rather an attack on some software behind a Tor hidden service. This attack was discussed in a thread on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-October/021822.html\">tor-talk</a> mailing list starting October 19th.</p>\n<p>The second story is around Eric Filiol's claims of compromising the Tor network leading up to his Hackers to Hackers talk in Brazil in a few days. This claim was initially announced by some French websites; however, it has spread further, such as this <a href=\"http://thehackernews.com/2011/10/tor-anonymizing-network-compromised-by.html\">Hacker News</a> story.</p>\n<p>Again, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-October/021722.html\">tor-talk</a> mailing list had the first discussions of these attacks back on October 13th. To be clear, neither Eric nor his researchers have disclosed anything about this attack to us. They have not talked to us, nor shared any data with us — despite some mail exchanges where we reminded him about the phrase &quot;responsible disclosure&quot;.</p>\n<p>Here's the attack as we understand it, from reading the various press reports:</p>\n<p>They enumerated 6000 IP addresses that they think are Tor relays. There aren't that many Tor relays in the world — <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html\">2500</a> is a more accurate number. We're not sure what caused them to overcount so much. Perhaps they watched the Tor network over a matter of weeks and collected a bunch of addresses that aren't relays anymore? The set of relays is public information, so there's no reason to collect your own list and certainly no reason to end up with a wrong list.</p>\n<p>One-third of the machines on those IP addresses are vulnerable to operating system or other system level attacks, meaning he can break in. That's quite a few! We wonder if that's true with the real Tor network, or just their simulated one? Even ignoring the question of what these 3500 extra IP addresses are, it's important to remember that one-third by number is not at all the same as one-third by capacity: Tor clients load-balance over relays based on the relay capacity, so any useful statement should be about how much of the <em>capacity</em> of the Tor network is vulnerable. It would indeed be shocking if one-third of the Tor network by capacity is vulnerable to external attacks.</p>\n<p>(There's also an aside about enumerating <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges\">bridges</a>. They say they found 181 bridges, and then there's a quote saying they \"now have a complete picture of the topography of Tor&quot;, which is a particularly unfortunate time for that quote since there are currently around 600 bridges running.)</p>\n<p>We expect the talk will include discussion about some cool Windows trick that can modify the crypto keys in a running Tor relay that you have local system access to; but it's simpler and smarter just to say that when the attacker has local system access to a Tor relay, the attacker controls the relay.</p>\n<p>Once they've broken into some relays, they do congestion attacks like <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#torspinISC08\">packet spinning</a> to congest the relays they couldn't compromise, to drive users toward the relays they own. It's unclear how many resources are needed to keep the rest of the relays continuously occupied long enough to keep the user from using them. There are probably some better heuristics that clients can use to distinguish between a loaded relay and an unavailable relay; we look forward to learning how well their attack here actually worked.</p>\n<p>From there, the attack gets vague. The only hint we have is this nonsense sentence from the article:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The remaining flow can then be decrypted via a fully method of attack called &quot;to clear unknown&quot; based on statistical analysis.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Do they have a new attack on AES, or on OpenSSL's implementation of it, or on our use of OpenSSL? Or are they instead doing some sort of timing attack, where if you own the client's first hop and also the destination you can use statistics to confirm that the two flows are on the same circuit? There's a history of <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough\">confused researchers</a> proclaiming some sort of novel active attack when passive correlation attacks are much simpler and just as effective.</p>\n<p>So the summary of the attack might be &quot;take control of the nodes you can, then congest the other ones so your targets avoid them and use the nodes you control. Then do some unspecified magic crypto attack to defeat the layers of encryption for later hops in the circuit.&quot; But really, these are just guesses based on the same news articles you're reading. We look forwarding to finding out if there's actually an attack we can fix, or if they are just playing all the journalists to get attention.</p>\n<p>More generally, there are two broader lessons to remember here. First, research into anonymity-breaking attacks is how the field moves forward, and using Tor for your target is <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/\">common</a> because a) it's resistant to all the simpler attacks and b) we make it <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/research.html.en\">really easy</a> to do your research on. And second, remember that most other anonymity systems out there fall to these attacks so quickly and thoroughly that no researchers even talk about it anymore. For some recent examples, see the single-hop proxy discussions in <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#tissec-latency-leak\">How Much Anonymity does Network Latency Leak?</a> and <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes11-panchenko\">Website Fingerprinting in Onion Routing Based Anonymization Networks</a>.</p>\n<p>I thank Roger, Nick, and Runa for helping with this post.</p>"

    "content": "<p><strong>Tor 0.2.2.34 fixes a critical anonymity vulnerability where an attacker<br />\ncan deanonymize Tor users. Everybody should upgrade.</strong></p>\n<p>The attack relies on four components: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>1) Clients reuse their TLS cert when talking to different relays, so relays can recognize a user by the identity key in her cert. </li>\n<li>2) An attacker who knows the client's identity key can probe each guard relay to see if that identity key is connected to that guard relay right now. </li>\n<li>3) A variety of active attacks in the literature (starting from \"Low-Cost Traffic Analysis of Tor\" by Murdoch and Danezis in 2005) allow a malicious website to discover the guard relays that a Tor user visiting the website is using. </li>\n<li>4) Clients typically pick three guards at random, so the set of guards for a given user could well be a unique fingerprint for her. This release fixes components #1 and #2, which is enough to block the attack; the other two remain as open research problems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Special thanks to \"frosty_un\" for reporting the issue to us! (As far as we know, this has nothing to do with any claimed attack currently getting attention in the media.)</p>\n<p><strong>Clients should upgrade so they are no longer recognizable by the TLS certs they present. Relays should upgrade so they no longer allow a remote attacker to probe them to test whether unpatched clients are currently connected to them.</strong></p>\n<p>This release also fixes several vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to enumerate bridge relays. Some bridge enumeration attacks still remain; see for example proposal 188.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://torproject.org/download/download-easy\" title=\"https://torproject.org/download/download-easy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://torproject.org/download/download-easy</a></p>\n<p>Changes in version 0.2.2.34 - 2011-10-26</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy/anonymity fixes (clients):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clients and bridges no longer send TLS certificate chains on outgoing OR<br />\nconnections. Previously, each client or bridge would use the same cert chain<br />\nfor all outgoing OR connections until its IP address changes, which allowed any<br />\nrelay that the client or bridge contacted to determine which entry guards it is<br />\nusing.  Fixes CVE-2011-2768. Bugfix on 0.0.9pre5; found by \"frosty_un\".</li>\n<li>If a relay receives a CREATE_FAST cell on a TLS connection, it no longer<br />\nconsiders that connection as suitable for satisfying a circuit EXTEND request.<br />\nNow relays can protect clients from the CVE-2011-2768 issue even if the clients<br />\nhaven't upgraded yet.</li>\n<li>Directory authorities no longer assign the Guard flag to relays that<br />\nhaven't upgraded to the above \"refuse EXTEND requests to client connections\"<br />\nfix. Now directory authorities can protect clients from the CVE-2011-2768 issue<br />\neven if neither the clients nor the relays have upgraded yet. There's a new<br />\n\"GiveGuardFlagTo_CVE_2011_2768_VulnerableRelays\" config option to let us<br />\ntransition smoothly, else tomorrow there would be no guard relays.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Privacy/anonymity fixes (bridge enumeration):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bridge relays now do their directory fetches inside Tor TLS connections,<br />\nlike all the other clients do, rather than connecting directly to the DirPort<br />\nlike public relays do. Removes another avenue for enumerating bridges. Fixes<br />\nbug 4115; bugfix on 0.2.0.35.</li>\n<li>Bridges relays now build circuits for themselves in a more similar way to<br />\nhow clients build them. Removes another avenue for enumerating bridges. Fixes<br />\nbug 4124; bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha, when bridges were introduced.</li>\n<li>Bridges now refuse CREATE or CREATE_FAST cells on OR connections that they<br />\ninitiated. Relays could distinguish incoming bridge connections from client<br />\nconnections, creating another avenue for enumerating bridges. Fixes<br />\nCVE-2011-2769. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.  Found by \"frosty_un\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a crash bug when changing node restrictions while a DNS lookup is<br />\nin-progress. Fixes bug 4259; bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha. Bugfix by \"Tey'\".</li>\n<li>Don't launch a useless circuit after failing to use one of a hidden<br />\nservice's introduction points. Previously, we would launch a new introduction<br />\ncircuit, but not set the hidden service which that circuit was intended to<br />\nconnect to, so it would never actually be used. A different piece of code would<br />\nthen create a new introduction circuit correctly. Bug reported by katmagic and<br />\nfound by Sebastian Hahn. Bugfix on 0.2.1.13-alpha; fixes bug 4212.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Change an integer overflow check in the OpenBSD_Malloc code so that GCC is<br />\nless likely to eliminate it as impossible. Patch from Mansour Moufid. Fixes bug<br />\n4059.</li>\n<li>When a hidden service turns an extra service-side introduction circuit into<br />\na general-purpose circuit, free the rend_data and intro_key fields first, so we<br />\nwon't leak memory if the circuit is cannibalized for use as another<br />\nservice-side introduction circuit. Bugfix on 0.2.1.7-alpha; fixes bug<br />\n4251.</li>\n<li>Bridges now skip DNS self-tests, to act a little more stealthily.  Fixes<br />\nbug 4201; bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha, which first introduced bridges. Patch by<br />\n\"warms0x\".</li>\n<li>Fix internal bug-checking logic that was supposed to catch failures in<br />\ndigest generation so that it will fail more robustly if we ask for a<br />\nnonexistent algorithm. Found by Coverity Scan.  Bugfix on 0.2.2.1-alpha; fixes<br />\nCoverity CID 479.</li>\n<li>Report any failure in init_keys() calls launched because our IP address has<br />\nchanged. Spotted by Coverity Scan. Bugfix on 0.1.1.4-alpha; fixes CID 484.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (log messages and documentation):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove a confusing dollar sign from the example fingerprint in the man<br />\npage, and also make the example fingerprint a valid one. Fixes bug 4309; bugfix<br />\non 0.2.1.3-alpha.</li>\n<li>The next version of Windows will be called Windows 8, and it has a major<br />\nversion of 6, minor version of 2. Correctly identify that version instead of<br />\ncalling it \"Very recent version\". Resolves ticket 4153; reported by<br />\nfunkstar.</li>\n<li>Downgrade log messages about circuit timeout calibration from \"notice\" to<br />\n\"info\": they don't require or suggest any human intervention. Patch from Tom<br />\nLowenthal. Fixes bug 4063; bugfix on 0.2.2.14-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn on directory request statistics by default and include them in<br />\nextra-info descriptors. Don't break if we have no GeoIP database.  Backported<br />\nfrom 0.2.3.1-alpha; implements ticket 3951.</li>\n<li>Update to the October 4 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>\n</ul>"

    "content": "<p>While we're exploring <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses\" rel=\"nofollow\">smarter ways of getting more bridge addresses</a>, and while the bridge arms race hasn't heated up yet in most countries (or has surpassed the number of bridges we have, in the case of China), it's the perfect time to take stock of bridge address enumeration attacks and how well we can defend against them.</p>\n<p>For background, <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridge relays</a> (aka bridges) are Tor relays that aren't listed in the main Tor directory. So even if an attacker blocks all the public relays, they still need to block all these \"private\" or \"dark\" relays too.</p>\n<p>Here are ten classes of attacks to discover bridges, examples of them we've seen or worry about in practice, and some ideas for how to resolve or mitigate each issue. If you're looking for a research project, please grab one and start investigating!</p>\n<p><strong>#1: Overwhelm the public address distribution strategies.</strong></p>\n<p>China broke our <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https bridge distribution strategy</a> in September 2009 by just pretending to be enough legitimate users from enough different subnets on the Internet. They broke the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges#FindingMore\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gmail bridge distribution strategy</a> in March 2010. These were easy to break because we don't have enough addresses relative to the size of the attacker (at this moment we're giving out 176 bridges by https and 201 bridges by Gmail, leaving us 165 to give out through other means like social networks), but it's not just a question of scale: we need better strategies that require attackers to do more or harder work than legitimate users.</p>\n<p><strong>#2: Run a non-guard non-exit relay and look for connections from non-relays.</strong></p>\n<p>Normal clients use <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards\" rel=\"nofollow\">guard nodes</a> for the first hop of their circuits to protect them from long-term profiling attacks; but we chose to have bridge users use their bridge as a replacement for the guard hop, so we don't force them onto four-hop paths which would be less fun to use. As a result, if you run a relay that doesn't have the Guard flag, the only Tors who end up building circuits through you are relays (which you can identify from the public consensus) and bridges.</p>\n<p>This attack has been floating around for a while, and is documented for example in Zhen Ling et al's <a href=\"http://www.cs.uml.edu/~xinwenfu/paper/Bridge.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Extensive Analysis and Large-Scale Empirical Evaluation of Tor Bridge Discovery</a> paper.</p>\n<p>The defense we plan is to make circuits through bridges use guards too. The naive way to do it would be for the client to choose a set of guards as her possible next hops after the bridge; but then each new client using the bridge increasingly exposures the bridge. The better approach is to make use of Tor's loose source routing feature to let the bridge itself choose the guards that all of the circuits it handles will use: that is, transparently layer an extra one-hop circuit inside the client's circuit. Those familiar with <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#babel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Babel's design</a> will recognize this trick by the name \"inter-mix detours\".</p>\n<p>Using a layer of guards after the bridge has two features: first, it completely removes the \"bridges directly touch non-guards\" issue, turning the attack from a deterministic one to a probabilistic one. Second, it reduces the exposure of the bridge to the rest of the network, since only a small set of relays will ever see a direct connection from it. The tradeoff, alas, is worse performance for bridge users. See <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/188-bridge-guards.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">proposal 188</a> for details.</p>\n<p>[Edit: a friendly researcher pointed out to me that another solution here is to run the bridge as multi-homed, meaning the address that the relay sees isn't the address that the censor should block. That solution also helps resolve issues 3-5!]</p>\n<p><strong>#3: Run a guard relay and look for protocol differences.</strong></p>\n<p>Bridges are supposed to behave like relays with respect to the users using them, but like clients with respect to the relays they make connections to. Any slip-ups we introduce where the bridge acts like a relay with respect to the next hop are ways the next hop can distinguish it. Recent examples include <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4115\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"bridges fetched directory information like relays rather than like clients\"</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4124\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"bridges didn't use a CREATE_FAST cell for the first hop of their own circuits like clients would have\"</a>, <a href=\"http://archives.seul.org/tor/commits/Oct-2011/msg01037.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"bridges didn't reject CREATE and CREATE_FAST cells on connections they had initiated like clients would have\"</a>, and <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4348\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"bridges distinguish themselves in their NETINFO cell\"</a>.</p>\n<p>There's no way that's the end of them. We could sure use some help auditing the design and code for similar issues.</p>\n<p><strong>#4: Run a guard relay and do timing analysis.</strong></p>\n<p>Even if we fix issues #2 and #3, it may still be possible for a guard relay to look at the \"clients\" that are connecting to it, and figure out based on latency that some of the circuits from those clients look like they're two hops away rather than one hop away.</p>\n<p>I bet there are active tricks to improve the attack accuracy. For example, the relay could watch round-trip latency from the circuit originator (seeing packets go towards Alice, and seeing how long until a packet shows up in response), and comparing that latency to what he sees when probing the previous hop with some cell that will get an immediate response rather than going all the way to Alice. Removing all the ways of probing round-trip latency to an adjacent Tor relay (either in-protocol or out-of-protocol) is a battle we're not going to win.</p>\n<p>The research question remains though: how hard is this attack in practice?  It's going to come down to statistics, which means it will be a game of driving up the false positives. It's hard to know how best to solve it until somebody does the engineering work for the attack.</p>\n<p>If the attack turns out to work well (and I expect it will), the \"bridges use guards\" design will limit the damage from the attack.</p>\n<p><strong>#5: Run a relay and try connecting back to likely ports on each client that connects to you.</strong></p>\n<p>Many bridges listen for incoming client connections on port 443 or 9001. The adversary can run a relay and actively portscan each client that connects, to see which ones are running services that speak the Tor protocol. This attack was published by Eugene Vasserman in <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#DBLP:conf/ccs/VassermanJTHK09\" rel=\"nofollow\">Membership-concealing overlay networks</a> and by Jon McLachlan in <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes09-bridge-attack\" rel=\"nofollow\">On the risks of serving whenever you surf: Vulnerabilities in Tor's blocking resistance design</a>, both in 2009.</p>\n<p>The \"bridges use guards\" design partially resolves this attack as well, since we limit the exposure of the bridge to a small group of relays that probably could have done some other above attacks as well.</p>\n<p>But it does not wholly resolve the concern: clients (and therefore also bridges) don't use their entry guards for directory fetches at present. So while the bridge won't build circuits through the relay it fetches directory information from, it will still reveal its existence. That's another reason to move forward with the <a href=\"http://archives.seul.org/tor/relays/Apr-2010/msg00078.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"directory guard\"</a> design.</p>\n<p><strong>#6: Scan the Internet for services that talk the Tor protocol.</strong></p>\n<p>Even if we successfully hide the bridges behind guards, the adversary can still blindly scan for them and pretend to be a client. To make it more practical, he could focus on scanning likely networks, or near other bridges he's discovered. We called this topic \"scanning resistance\" in our original <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#tor-blocking\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridge design paper</a>.</p>\n<p>There's a particularly insidious combination of #5 and #6 if you're a government-scale adversary: watch your government firewall for SSL flows (since Tor tries to blend in with SSL traffic), and do active followup probing to every destination you see. Whitelist sites you've already checked if you want to trade efficiency for precision. This scale of attack requires some serious engineering work for a large country, but <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4185\" rel=\"nofollow\">early indications</a> are that China might be investigating exactly this approach.</p>\n<p>The answer here is to give the bridge user some secret when she learns the bridge address, and require her to prove knowledge of that secret before the bridge will admit to knowing the Tor protocol. For example, we could imagine running an Apache SSL webserver with a <a href=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/37735/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">pass-through module</a> that tunnels your traffic to the Tor relay once she's presented the right password. Or <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/187-allow-client-auth.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tor could handle that authentication itself</a>. <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes11-bridgespa\" rel=\"nofollow\">BridgeSPA: Improving Tor Bridges with Single Packet Authorization</a> offers an SPA-style approach, with the drawbacks of requiring root on both sides and being OS-specific.</p>\n<p>Another avenue to explore is putting some of the bridge addresses behind a service like <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#usenix11-telex\" rel=\"nofollow\">Telex</a>, <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#foci11-decoy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Decoy Routing</a>, or <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs2011-cirripede\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cirripede</a>.  These designs let users privately tag a flow (e.g. an SSL handshake) in such a way that tagged flows are diverted to a Tor bridge while untagged flows continue as normal. So now we could deploy a vanilla Apache in one place and a vanilla Tor bridge in another, and not have to modify either of them. The Tor client bundle would need an extra piece of software though, and there are still some engineering and deployment details to be worked out.</p>\n<p><strong>#7: Break into the Tor Project infrastructure.</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/blocking.html#tth_sEc5.2\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridge directory authority</a> aggregates the list of bridges and periodically sends it to the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git/tree\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridgedb service</a> so it can parcel addresses out by its various distribution strategies. Breaking into either of these services would give you the list of bridges.</p>\n<p>We can imagine some design changes to make the risk less bad. For one, people can already run bridges that don't publish to the bridge directory authority (and then distribute their addresses themselves). Second, I had a nice chat with a Chinese NGO recently who wants to set up a bridge directory authority of their own, and distribute custom Vidalia bridge bundles to their members that are configured to publish their bridge addresses to this alternate bridge directory authority. A third option is to decentralize the bridge authority and bridgedb services, such that each component only learns about a fraction of the total bridge population &mdash; that design quickly gets messy though in terms of engineering and in terms of analyzing its security against various attacks.</p>\n<p><strong>#8: Just watch the bridge authority's reachability tests.</strong></p>\n<p>You don't actually need to break in to the bridge authority. Instead, you can just monitor its network connection: it will periodically test reachability of each bridge it knows, in order to let the bridgedb service know which addresses to give out.</p>\n<p>We could do these reachability tests through Tor, so watching the bridge authority doesn't tell you anything about what it's testing. But that just shifts the risk onto the rest of the relays, such that an adversary who runs or monitors a sample of relays gets to learn about a corresponding sample of bridges.</p>\n<p>One option is to decentralize the testing such that monitoring a single location doesn't give you the whole bridge list. But how exactly to distribute it, and onto what, is messy from both the operational and research angles. Another option would be for the bridges themselves to ramp up the frequency of their reachability tests (they currently self-test for reachability before publishing, to give quick feedback to their operator if they're misconfigured). Then the bridges can just anonymously publish an authenticated \"still here\" message once an hour, so (assuming they all tell the truth) the bridge authority never has to do any testing. But this self-testing also allows an enumeration attack, since we build a circuit to a random relay and then try to extend back to our bridge address! Maybe bridges should be asking their guards to do the self-testing &mdash; once they have guards, that is?</p>\n<p>These questions are related to the question of <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/blocking.html#subsec:geoip\" rel=\"nofollow\">learning whether a bridge has been blocked in a given country</a>. More on that in a future blog post.</p>\n<p><strong>#9: Watch your firewall and DPI for Tor flows.</strong></p>\n<p>While the above attacks have to do with recognizing or inducing bridge-specific behavior, another class of attacks is just to buy some fancy Deep Packet Inspection gear and have it look for, say, characteristics of the SSL certificates or handshakes that make Tor flows stand out from \"normal\" SSL flows. <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-blocks-tor-tor-releases-same-day-fix\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iran has used this strategy</a> to block Tor twice, and it lets them block bridges for free. The attack is most effective if you have a large and diverse population of Tor users behind your firewall, since you'll only be able to learn about bridges that your users try to use.</p>\n<p>We can fix the issue by <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/179-TLS-cert-and-parameter-normalization.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">making Tor's handshake more like a normal SSL handshake</a>, but I wonder if that's really a battle we can ever win. The better answer is to encourage a proliferation of <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/180-pluggable-transport.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">modular Tor transports</a>, like <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/tor-obfs-howto.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">obfsproxy</a>, and get the rest of the research community interested in designing tool-neutral transports that blend in better.</p>\n<p><strong>#10: Zig-zag between bridges and users.</strong></p>\n<p>Start with a set of known bridge addresses. Watch your firewall to see who connects to those bridges. Then watch those users, and see what other addresses they connect to. Wash, rinse, repeat.</p>\n<p>As above, this attack only works well when you have a large population of Tor users behind your firewall. It also requires some more engineering work to be able to trace source addresses in addition to destination addresses. But I'd be surprised if some major government firewalls don't have this capability already.</p>\n<p>The solution here probably involves partitioning bridge addresses into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clandestine_cell_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">cells</a>, such that zig-zagging from users to bridges only gives you a bounded set of bridges (and a bounded set of users, for that matter). That approach will require some changes in our <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git/blob/HEAD:/bridge-db-spec.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridgedb design</a> though. Currently when a user requests some bridge addresses, bridgedb maps the user's \"address\" (IP address, gmail account name, or whatever) into a point in the keyspace (using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing\" rel=\"nofollow\">consistent hashing</a>), and the answers are the k successors of that point in the ring (using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_%28DHT%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">DHT</a> terminology).</p>\n<p>Dan Boneh suggested an alternate approach where we do <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC\" rel=\"nofollow\">keyed hashes</a> of the user's address and all the bridge fingerprints, and return all bridges whose hashed fingerprints match the user's hash in the first b bits. The result is that users would tend to get clustered by the bridges they know. That feature limits the damage from the zig-zag attack, but does it increase the risks in some distribution strategies? I already worry that bridge distribution strategies based on social networks will result in clusters of socially related users using the same bridges, meaning the attacker can reconstruct the social network. If we isolate socially related users in the same partition, do we magnify that problem?  This approach also needs more research work to make it scale such that we can always return about k results, even as the address pool grows, and without reintroducing zig-zag vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>#11: ...What did I miss?</strong></p>"

    "content": "<p>Tor currently transports data over encrypted TLS tunnels between nodes, in turn carried by TCP. This has worked reasonably well, but recent research has shown that it might not be the best option, particularly for performance.</p>\n<p>For example, when a packet gets dropped or corrupted on a link between two Tor nodes, TCP will cause the packet to be retransmitted eventually. However, in the meantime, all circuits passing through this pair of nodes will be stalled, not only the circuit corresponding to the packet which was dropped.</p>\n<p>Also, Tor uses two levels of congestion control; TCP for hop-by-hop links, and a custom scheme for circuits. This might not be the right approach -- maybe these schemes aren't the right ones to use or maybe there should only be one level of congestion control.</p>\n<p>There have been a variety of solutions proposed to fix one or both of these problems, Most end up sending data as datagrams in UDP packets, and Tor is responsible for managing congestion and recovering from packet loss, and so can (hopefully) do so in a more intelligent way. However, there are many options for what architecture to use, what building blocks to build these schemes from, and how to tweak the many parameters that result.</p>\n<p>To help clarify the various options, I've written a summary of both Tor's current network stack architecture and various proposals for how it can be improved. The document discusses various tradeoffs between the approaches, including performance, security, and engineering difficulties in deploying the solution. It ends with some provisional conclusions about which options are most promising.</p>\n<p>The document, &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/tor11datagramcomparison.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Comparison of Tor Datagram Designs</a>&#8221;, is now available (with source in <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/sjm217/torspec.git/tree/datagram_comparison:/proposals/ideas/xxx-datagram-comparison\" rel=\"nofollow\">git</a>), and I would welcome comments. Over the next few months I'll be working on building and evaluating prototypes for these schemes, and I will be incorporating feedback from the Tor community into the process.</p>"

This fixes CVE-2011-2768 and CVE-2011-2769 which prompted for manual updates for users of Tails 0.8.1.<br />\n - Suppress Tor's warning about applications doing their own DNS lookups. Some users have reported concerns about these warnings, but it should be noted that they are completely harmless inside Tails as its system DNS resolver is Torified.</p>\n<p> - Linux 3.0.0-6, which fixed a great number of bugs and security issues.</p>\n<p>## Iceweasel<br />\n - Upgrade to 3.5.16-11 ((fixes CVE-2011-3647, CVE-2011-3648, CVE-2011-3650).<br />\n - Torbutton: upgrade to 1.4.4.1-1, including support for the in-browser \"New identity\" feature.<br />\n - FireGPG: upgrade to 0.8-1+tails2. Users are notified that the FireGPG Text Editor is the only safe place for performing cryptographic operations, and these operations has been disabled in other places. Performing them outside of the editor opens up several severe attacks through JavaScript (e.g. leaking plaintext when decrypting, signing messages written by the attacker).<br />\n - Replace CS Lite with Cookie Monster for cookie management. Cookie Monster has an arguably nicer interface, is being actively maintained and is packaged in Debian.</p>\n<p>## Software<br />\n - Install MAT, the Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit. Its goal is to remove file metadata which otherwise could leak information about you in the documents and media files you publish. This is the result of a Tails developer's suggestion for GSoC 2011, although it ended up being mentored by The Tor Project.<br />\n - Upgrade WhisperBack to 1.5~rc1. Users are guided how to send their bug reports through alternative channels upon errors sending them. This will make bug reporting easier when there's no network connection available.<br />\n - Upgrade TrueCrypt to 7.1.</p>\n<p>## Miscellaneous<br />\n - The date and time setting system was completely reworked. This should prevent time syncing issues that may prevent Tor from working properly, which some users have reported. The new system will not leave a fingerprintable network signature, like the old system did. Previously that signature could be used to identify who is using Tails (but not deanonymize them).<br />\n - Erase memory at shutdown: run many instances of the memory wiper. Due to architectural limitations of i386 a process cannot access all memory at the same time, and hence a single memory wipe instance cannot clear all memory.<br />\n - Saner keyboard layouts for Arabic and Russian.<br />\n - Use Plymouth text-only splash screen at boot time.</p>\n<p>Plus the usual bunch of minor bug reports and improvements.

By setting up a bridge, you donate bandwidth to the Tor network and help improve the safety and speed at which users can access the Internet.</p>\n<p>Bridges are Tor relays that aren't listed in the main directory. This means that to use a bridge, you'll need to locate one first. And because there is no complete public list of all the bridges, they are also harder to block. A bridge will act as the first hop in a circuit, and will only forward traffic on to other relays in the Tor network.</p>\n<p>Setting up a Tor bridge on Amazon EC2 is simple and will only take you a couple of minutes. The images have been configured with automatic package updates and port forwarding, so you do not have to worry about Tor not working or the server not getting security updates. </p>\n<p>You should not have to do anything once the instance is up and running. Tor will start up as a bridge, confirm that it is reachable from the outside, and then tell the bridge authority that it exists. After that, the address for your bridge will be given out to users.</p>\n<p>To help new customers get started in the cloud, Amazon is introducing a free usage tier. The Tor Cloud images are all micro instances, and new customers will be able to run a free micro instance for a whole year. The Tor Cloud images have been configured with a bandwidth limit, so customers who don't qualify for the free usage tier should only have to pay an estimated $30 a month.</p>\n<p>For more information, see the <a href=\"https://cloud.torproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tor Cloud</a> website.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Some users have asked about the AWS free usage tier and pointed out that it only includes 15 GB of bandwidth out per month. I have updated the Tor Cloud website (changes should go live soon) with the following:<br />\n<em><br />\nThe Tor Cloud images have been configured to use no more than 40 GB of bandwidth out per month. We have estimated that customers who do not qualify for the free usage tier will pay up to $30 a month. Customers who qualify for the free usage tier, but who run bridges that use more than 15 GB of bandwidth out per month, will pay up to $3 per month.<br />\n</em><br />\nI hope that this better clarifies the cost of running a bridge in the Amazon cloud, let me know if you have any questions.</p>"

It adds<br />\n  support to serve microdescriptors to controllers, so Vidalia's network<br />\n  map can resume listing relays (once Vidalia implements its side),<br />\n  and adds better support for hardware AES acceleration. Finally, it<br />\n  starts the process of adjusting the bandwidth cutoff for getting the<br />\n  \"Fast\" flag from 20KB to (currently) 32KB -- preliminary results show<br />\n  that tiny relays harm performance more than they help network capacity.</p>\n<p><strong>Changes in version 0.2.3.8-alpha - 2011-11-22</strong><br />\n<strong>Major bugfixes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Initialize Libevent with the EVENT_BASE_FLAG_NOLOCK flag enabled, so<br />\n      that it doesn't attempt to allocate a socketpair. This could cause<br />\n      some problems on Windows systems with overzealous firewalls. Fix for<br />\n      bug 4457; workaround for Libevent versions 2.0.1-alpha through<br />\n      2.0.15-stable.</li>\n<li>Correctly sanity-check that we don't underflow on a memory<br />\n      allocation (and then assert) for hidden service introduction<br />\n      point decryption. Bug discovered by Dan Rosenberg. Fixes bug 4410;<br />\n      bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.</li>\n<li>Remove the artificially low cutoff of 20KB to guarantee the Fast<br />\n      flag. In the past few years the average relay speed has picked<br />\n      up, and while the \"top 7/8 of the network get the Fast flag\" and<br />\n      \"all relays with 20KB or more of capacity get the Fast flag\" rules<br />\n      used to have the same result, now the top 7/8 of the network has<br />\n      a capacity more like 32KB. Bugfix on 0.2.1.14-rc. Fixes bug 4489.</li>\n<li>Fix a rare assertion failure when checking whether a v0 hidden<br />\n      service descriptor has any usable introduction points left, and<br />\n      we don't have enough information to build a circuit to the first<br />\n      intro point named in the descriptor. The HS client code in<br />\n      0.2.3.x no longer uses v0 HS descriptors, but this assertion can<br />\n      trigger on (and crash) v0 HS authorities. Fixes bug 4411.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.3.1-alpha; diagnosed by frosty_un.</li>\n<li>Make bridge authorities not crash when they are asked for their own<br />\n      descriptor. Bugfix on 0.2.3.7-alpha, reported by Lucky Green.</li>\n<li>When running as a client, do not print a misleading (and plain<br />\n      wrong) log message that we're collecting \"directory request\"<br />\n      statistics: clients don't collect statistics. Also don't create a<br />\n      useless (because empty) stats file in the stats/ directory.

Previously,<br />\n      microdescriptors were only available by their own digests, so a<br />\n      controller would have to ask for and parse the whole microdescriptor<br />\n      consensus in order to look up a single relay's microdesc. Fixes<br />\n      bug 3832; bugfix on 0.2.3.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>Use OpenSSL's EVP interface for AES encryption, so that all AES<br />\n      operations can use hardware acceleration (if present). Resolves<br />\n      ticket 4442.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.2.x and earlier):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Detect failure to initialize Libevent. This fix provides better<br />\n      detection for future instances of bug 4457.</li>\n<li>Avoid frequent calls to the fairly expensive cull_wedged_cpuworkers<br />\n      function. This was eating up hideously large amounts of time on some<br />\n      busy servers. Fixes bug 4518; bugfix on 0.0.9.8.</li>\n<li>Don't warn about unused log_mutex in log.c when building with<br />\n      --disable-threads using a recent GCC. Fixes bug 4437; bugfix on<br />\n      0.1.0.6-rc which introduced --disable-threads.</li>\n<li>Allow manual 'authenticate' commands to the controller interface<br />\n      from netcat (nc) as well as telnet. We were rejecting them because<br />\n      they didn't come with the expected whitespace at the end of the<br />\n      command. Bugfix on 0.1.1.1-alpha; fixes bug 2893.</li>\n<li>Fix some (not actually triggerable) buffer size checks in usage of<br />\n      tor_inet_ntop. Fixes bug 4434; bugfix on Tor 0.2.0.1-alpha. Patch<br />\n      by Anders Sundman.</li>\n<li>Fix parsing of some corner-cases with tor_inet_pton().

Fixes bug<br />\n      4424. Bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.</li>\n<li>Fix a memory leak in launch_direct_bridge_descriptor_fetch() that<br />\n      occurred when a client tried to fetch a descriptor for a bridge<br />\n      in ExcludeNodes. Fixes bug 4383; bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on 0.2.3.x):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Make util unit tests build correctly with MSVC.

Fixes bug 4368; fix on 0.2.3.6-alpha; bug found by<br />\n      \"frosty\".</li>\n<li>Log less loudly when we get an invalid authentication certificate<br />\n      from a source other than a directory authority: it's not unusual<br />\n      to see invalid certs because of clock skew. Fixes bug 4370; bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.3.4-alpha and 0.2.3.6-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Add two new config options for directory authorities:<br />\n      AuthDirFastGuarantee sets a bandwidth threshold for guaranteeing the<br />\n      Fast flag, and AuthDirGuardBWGuarantee sets a bandwidth threshold<br />\n      that is always sufficient to satisfy the bandwidth requirement for<br />\n      the Guard flag. Now it will be easier for researchers to simulate<br />\n      Tor networks with different values. Resolves ticket 4484.</li>\n<li>When Tor ignores a hidden service specified in its configuration,<br />\n      include the hidden service's directory in the warning message.<br />\n      Previously, we would only tell the user that some hidden service<br />\n      was ignored. Bugfix on 0.0.6; fixes bug 4426.</li>\n<li>When we fail to initialize Libevent, retry with IOCP disabled so we<br />\n      don't need to turn on multi-threading support in Libevent, which in<br />\n      turn requires a working socketpair(). This is a workaround for bug<br />\n      4457, which affects Libevent versions from 2.0.1-alpha through<br />\n      2.0.15-stable.</li>\n<li>Detect when we try to build on a platform that doesn't define<br />\n      AF_UNSPEC to 0. We don't work there, so refuse to compile.</li>\n<li>Update to the November 1 2011 Maxmind GeoLite Country database.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Packaging changes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Make it easier to automate expert package builds on Windows,<br />\n      by removing an absolute path from makensis.exe command.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Code simplifications and refactoring:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove some redundant #include directives throughout the code.<br />\n      Patch from Andrea Gelmini.</li>\n<li>Unconditionally use OpenSSL's AES implementation instead of our<br />\n      old built-in one. OpenSSL's AES has been better for a while, and<br />\n      relatively few servers should still be on any version of OpenSSL<br />\n      that doesn't have good optimized assembly AES.</li>\n<li>Use the name \"CERTS\" consistently to refer to the new cell type;<br />\n      we were calling it CERT in some places and CERTS in others.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Testing:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Numerous new unit tests for functions in util.c and address.c by<br />\n      Anders Sundman.</li>\n<li>The long-disabled benchmark tests are now split into their own<br />\n      ./src/test/bench binary.</li>\n<li>The benchmark tests can now use more accurate timers than<br />\n      gettimeofday() when such timers are available.</li>\n</ul>"

    "content": "<p><strong>Different Ways to Use a Bridge</strong></p>\n<p>When some adversary prevents users from reaching the Tor network, our most popular answer is using bridge relays (or bridges for short). Those are hidden relays, not listed along with all the other relays in the networkstatus documents.  Currently, we have about 600 of them, and censors are having different luck learning and blocking them &mdash; see <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problems-ten-ways-discover-tor-bridges\">the 10 ways to discover Tor bridges blog post</a> for more on how discovery approaches may work. China appears to be the only place able to successfully block most bridges consistently, whereas other places occasionally manage to block Tor's handshake and as a byproduct block all bridges too.</p>\n<p>Bridge users can be broadly grouped in three camps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tor is blocked, and some way &mdash; any way &mdash; to reach the network has to be found. The adversary is not very dangerous, but very annoying.</li>\n<li>Tor may or may not be blocked, but the user is trying to hide the fact they're hiding Tor. The adversary may be extremely dangerous.</li>\n<li>Other bridge users: Testing whether the bridge works (automated or manual), probing, people using bridges without their knowledge because they came pre-configured in their bundle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here we examine the first two use cases more closely. Specifically, we want to look at properties of a bridge that must exist for it to be useful to a user.</p>\n<p><strong>Bridges &mdash; building blocks</strong></p>\n<p>First off, it is helpful to understand some basics about bridges and how they are used by normal users.</p>\n<p>Bridges are very similar to ordinary relays, in that they are operated by volunteers who made the decision to help people reach the Tor network. The difference to a normal relay is where the information about the bridge is published to &mdash; bridges can choose to either publish to the Bridge Authority (a special relay collecting all bridge addresses that it receives), or to not publish their information anywhere. The former are called public bridges, the latter private bridges.</p>\n<p>We don't have any information about the number of private bridges, but since the Bridge Authority collects data about the public bridges, we do know that bridges are used in the real world. See <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html#bridge-users\">the bridge users</a> and <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html#networksize\">networksize</a> graphs for some examples. Not having data about private bridges or their users means some of the analysis below is based on discussions with users of private bridges and our best estimates, and it can't be backed up by statistical data.</p>\n<p>The reason we're using a Bridge Authority and collecting information about bridges is that we want to give out bridges to people who aren't in a position to learn about a private bridge themselves.</p>\n<p>\"Learning about a bridge\" generally means learning about the bridge's IP address and port, so that a connection can be made. Optionally, the bridge identity fingerprint is included, too &mdash; this helps the client to verify that it is actually talking to the bridge, and not someone that is intercepting the network communication. For a private bridge, the operator has to pass on that information; public bridges wrap up some information about themselves in what is called their bridge descriptor and send that to the bridge authority. The bridge descriptor includes some statistical information, like aggregated user counts and countries of origin of traffic. Our analysis here focuses solely on the data provided by public bridges.</p>\n<p>Once a user has learned about some bridges, she configures her Tor client to use them, typically by entering them into the appropriate field in Vidalia. Alternatively, she might use a different controller or put the data into tor's configuration file directly.</p>\n<p><strong>Learning from bridge descriptor fetches</strong></p>\n<p>We've been collecting bridge descriptor fetch statistics on the bridge authority, and are using this data to pose some questions and propose some changes. The statistics collected are how many bridge descriptors were served in total, and how many unique descriptors were served, as well as the 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 percentiles of fetches per descriptor. Every 24 hours, the current statistics are written to disk and the counters reset. The current statistics are attached to this post, for closer inspection. We've also prepared two graphs to easily see the data at a glance:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/bridge-total-downloads.png\" alt=\"Total bridge downloads\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/bridge-downloads-per-desc.png\" alt=\"Bridge downloads per descriptor\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<p>The first thing to note is that there aren't very many bridge descriptor fetches at all, which isn't a big surprise: The current Tor bundles don't fetch them when they're used in the typical way, that is by adding some bridges via Vidalia's interface after bridges were discovered via one of our bridge distribution channels. Over the past month, there have been between 3900 and 6600 fetches per day, with a median of 8 fetches per bridge. The most fetched descriptor is fetched up to 350 times per day, indicating that it does indeed belong to a bridge that was given out with a fingerprint and being used by Tor clients. We have gotten some reports that a bundle circulated with pre-configured bridges, and this could account for the many fetches.</p>\n<p>Secondly, most bridge descriptors are not even fetched from the authority. This is a clear indication that we can improve our odds of updating bridge clients with current bridge info if we can get them to request the information better.</p>\n<p><strong>Improving Tor's behaviour for the two user groups</strong></p>\n<p>The first group (\"Tor is blocked, and some way to reach the network has to be found\") is mostly concerned about circumvention, without necessarily hiding that they're using Tor from someone. Typically, access to the Internet is filtered, but circumventing a filter isn't too risky and people are more concerned with access than hiding their tracks from a data-collecting adversary. Speed, bootstrapping performance, and little intervention/maintenance of a setup are the biggest goals.</p>\n<p>Adding auto-discovery mechanisms for bridges that changed their IP address will help this group gain a lot more robustness when it comes to maintaining connectivity against an adversary that blocks public relays, but isn't very quick in blocking all bridges. As far as we know, this is currently true for the majority of our bridge userbase.</p>\n<p>For the second group (\"Tor may or may not be blocked, but the user is trying to hide the fact they're hiding Tor\"), precise control over Tor's actions is much more important than constant connectivity, and private bridges might be utilized to that end as well. A user in this group wants to keep the bridges he's using secret, and puts up with frequent updates to the configuration for the added safety of only connecting to a pre-specified IP address:port combination. We can't do very much for a user belonging to this group with regard to bridges, but he will very much benefit from improvements made to our general fingerprintability resistance. Also options like the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3644\">DisableNetwork</a> option (prevent touching the network in any kind of way until this option is changed) that was recently introduced to Tor help him.</p>\n<p>Another interesting point here is that we can indirectly improve the behaviour for the first group by not making it too easy to learn about bridges, because censors can use the same data to more effectively block them. This means that we shouldn't, for example, start giving out significantly more bridges to a single user.</p>\n<p>We've written a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2011-November/003097.html\">proposal</a> to implement some changes in Tor, to better facilitate the needs of the first group of bridge users.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Once we get <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses\" rel=\"nofollow\">more (and more diverse) bridge addresses</a>, the next research step is that we'll need to get better at telling which bridges are blocked in which jurisdictions. For example, most of the bridges we give out via https and gmail are blocked in China. But which ones exactly? How quickly do they get blocked? Do some last longer than others? Do they ever get unblocked? Is there some pattern to the blocking, either by time, by IP address or network, by user load on the bridge, or by distribution strategy? We can't evaluate <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bridge-distribution-strategies\" rel=\"nofollow\">new bridge distribution strategies</a> if we can't track whether the bridges in each strategy are being blocked. </p>\n<p>Generally speaking, bridge reachability tests break down into two approaches: passive and active. Passive tests don't involve any new connections on the part of Tor clients or bridges, whereas active tests follow the more traditional \"scanning\" idea. None of the reachability tests we've thought of are perfect. Instead, here we discuss how to combine imperfect tests and use feedback from the tests to balance their strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive approaches</strong></p>\n<p>We should explore two types of passive testing approaches: reporting from bridges and reporting from clients.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive approach 1: reporting from bridges.</strong> Right now Tor relays and bridges publish <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/wecsr10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">aggregate user counts</a> &mdash; rough number of users per country per day. In theory we can look at the user counts over time to detect statistical drops in usage for a given country. That approach has produced useful results in practice for overall connections to the public Tor relays from each country: see George Danezis's <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/detector-2011-09-09.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">initial work</a> on a Tor censorship detector.</p>\n<p>But there are two stumbling blocks when trying to apply the censorship detector model to individual bridges. First, we don't have ground truth about which bridges were <em>actually</em> blocked or not at a given time, so we have no way to validate our models. Second, while overall usage of bridges in a given country might be high, the load <em>on a given bridge</em> tends to be quite low, which in turns makes it <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/blocking-2011-09-15.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">difficult to achieve statistical significance</a> when looking at usage drops.</p>\n<p>Ground truth needs to be learned through active tests: we train the models with usage patterns for bridges that get blocked and bridges that don't get blocked, and the model predictions should improve. The question of statistical significance can be overcome by treating the prediction as a hint: even if our models don't give us enough confidence to answer \"blocked for sure\" or \"not blocked for sure\" about a given bridge, they should be able to give us a number reflecting likelihood that the bridge is now blocked. That number should feed back into the active tests, for example so we pay more attention to bridges that are more likely to be newly blocked.</p>\n<p><strong>Passive approach 2: reporting from clients.</strong> In addition to the usage reporting by bridges, we should also consider reachability reporting by clients. Imagine a Tor client that has ten bridges configured. It tries to connect to each of them, and finds that two work and eight don't. This client is doing our scanning for us, if only we could safely learn about its results. The first issue that comes up is that it could mistakenly report that a bridge is blocked if that bridge is instead simply down. So we would want to compare the reports to concurrent active scans from a \"more free\" jurisdiction, to pick out the bridges that are up in one place yet down in another.</p>\n<p>From there, the questions get trickier: 1) does the set of bridges that a given user reports about create a fingerprint that lets us recognize that user later? Even if the user reports about each bridge through a separate Tor circuit, we'd like to know the time of the scan, and nearby times can be used to build a statistical profile. 2) What if users submit intentionally misleading reports? It seems there's a tension between wanting to build a profile for the user (to increase our confidence in the validity of her reports) versus wanting to make sure the user doesn't develop any recognizable profile. Perhaps the <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#oakland11-formalizing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nymble</a> design family can contribute an \"unlinkable reputation\" trick to resolve the conflict, but as we find ourselves saying so often at Tor, more research remains.</p>\n<p><strong>Active approaches</strong></p>\n<p>The goal of active scanning is to get ground truth on whether each bridge is really blocked. There's a tradeoff here: frequent scans give us better resolution and increased confidence, but too many scan attempts draw attention to the scanners and thus to the addresses being scanned. </p>\n<p>We should use the results of the passive and indirect scans to give hints about what addresses to do active scans on. In the steady-state, we should aim to limit our active scans to bridges that we think just went from unblocked to blocked or vice versa, and to a sample of others for spot checks to keep our models trained. </p>\n<p>There are three pieces to active scanning: direct scans, reverse scans, and indirect scans. </p>\n<p><strong>Active approach 1: direct scans.</strong> Direct scans are what we traditionally think of when we think of scanning: get access to a computer in the target country, give it a list of bridges, and have it connect directly to each bridge on the list.</p>\n<p>Before I continue though, I should take an aside to discuss types of blocking. In September 2009 when China first blocked some bridges, I spent a while probing the blocked bridges from a computer in Beijing. From what I could tell, China blocked the bridges in two ways. If the bridge had no other interesting services running (like a webserver), they just blackholed the IP address, meaning no packets to or from the IP address made it through the firewall. But if there <em>was</em> an interesting service, they blocked the bridge by IP and port. (I could imagine this more fine-grained blocking was done by dropping SYN packets, or by sending TCP RST packets; but I didn't get that far in my investigation.)</p>\n<p>So there are two lessons to be learned here. First, the degree to which our active scans match real Tor client behavior could influence the accuracy of the scans. Second, some real-world adversaries are putting considerable effort &mdash; probably manual effort &mdash; into examining the bridges they find and choosing how best to filter them. After all, if they just blindly filtered IP addresses we list as bridges, we could add Baidu's address as a bridge and make them look foolish. (We tried that; it didn't work.)</p>\n<p>These lessons leave us with two design choices to consider.</p>\n<p>First, how much of the Tor protocol should we use when doing the scans? The spectrum ranges from a simple TCP scan (or even just a SYN scan), to a vanilla SSL handshake, to driving a real Tor client that does a genuine Tor handshake. The less realistic the handshake, the more risk that we conclude the bridge is reachable when in fact it isn't; but the more realistic the handshake, the more we stand out to an adversary watching for Tor-like traffic.</p>\n<p>The mechanism by which the adversary is <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problems-ten-ways-discover-tor-bridges\" rel=\"nofollow\">discovering bridges</a> also impacts which reachability tests are a smart idea. For example, it appears that China may have recently started doing deep packet inspection (DPI) for Tor-like connections over the Great Firewall and then doing active-followup SSL handshakes to confirm which addresses are Tor bridges. If that report turns out to be true, testing bridge reachability via active scans that include handshaking would be counterproductive: the act of doing the test would influence the answer. We can solve their attack by <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-blocks-tor-tor-releases-same-day-fix\" rel=\"nofollow\">changing our handshake</a> so they don't recognize it anymore, or by introducing <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/blocking.html#tth_sEc9.3\" rel=\"nofollow\">scanning-resistance</a> measures like bridge passwords. In the shorter-term, we should confirm that simple connection scanning (without a handshake) doesn't trigger any blocks, and then restrict ourselves to that type of scanning in China until we've deployed a better answer.</p>\n<p>Second, should we scan \"decoy\" addresses as well, to fool an observer into thinking that we're not scanning for Tor bridges in particular, and/or to drive up the work the observer needs to do to distinguish the \"real\" bridges? Whether this trick is useful depends on the level of sophistication and dedication of the adversary. For example, China has already demonstrated that they check IP addresses before blocking them, and in general I worry that the more connections you make to <em>anything</em>, the more likely you are to attract attention for further scrutiny. How would we generate the list of decoy addresses? If we choose it randomly from the space of IP addresses, a) most of them will not respond, and b) we'll invite abuse complaints from security people looking for worms. Driving up the work factor sounds like a great feature, but it could have the side effect that it encourages the adversary to invest in an automated \"is this a Tor bridge\" checker, which would be an unfortunate step for them to take if they otherwise wouldn't.</p>\n<p>Active direct scans come with a fundamental dilemma: the more we think a bridge has been blocked, the more we want to scan it; but the more likely it is to be blocked, the more the adversary might already be watching for connections to it, for example to do a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problems-ten-ways-discover-tor-bridges\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"zig-zag\" bridge enumeration attack</a>. So we need to avoid scanning bridges that we think are not blocked. But we also need to explore more subtle scanning techniques such as the ones below.</p>\n<p><strong>Active approach 2: reverse scans.</strong> A bridge that gets <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplex_%28telecommunications%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">duplex</a> blackholed by a government firewall can learn that it has been filtered by trying to make a connection <em>into</em> the filtered country.</p>\n<p>For example, each bridge might automatically connect to baidu.com periodically, and publish the results of its reachability test in its extrainfo descriptor. We could either feed this information into the models and follow up with other active probes if the bridge thinks it's been blocked; or we could use it the other way by instructing bridges that we think have been blocked to launch a reverse scan.</p>\n<p>We can actually take advantage of the flexibility of the Tor protocol to do scanning from each bridge to Baidu without changing the bridge code at all: we simply try to extend an ordinary circuit from the bridge to the target destination, and learn at what stage the 'extend' request failed. (We should <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2576\" rel=\"nofollow\">extend the Tor control protocol</a> to expose the type of failure to the Tor controller, but that's a simple matter of programming.)</p>\n<p>Note that these reverse scans can tell us that a bridge has been blocked, but it can't tell us that a bridge <em>hasn't</em> been blocked, since it could just be blocked in a more fine-grained way.</p>\n<p>Finally, how noticeable would these reverse scans be? That is, could the government firewall enumerate bridges by keeping an eye out for Tor-like connection attempts to Baidu? While teaching the bridges to do the scanning themselves would require more work, it would give us more control over how much the scans stick out.</p>\n<p><strong>Active approach 3: indirect scans.</strong> Indirect scans use other services as reflectors. For example, you can connect to an FTP server inside the target country, tell it that your address is the address of the bridge you want to scan, and then try to fetch a file. How it fails should tell you whether that FTP server could reach the bridge or not.</p>\n<p>There are many other potential reflector protocols out there, each with their own tradeoffs. For example, can we instruct a DNS request in-country to recurse to the target bridge address, and distinguish between \"I couldn't reach that DNS server\" and \"that wasn't a DNS server\"? (DNS is probably not the right protocol to use inside China, given the amount of DNS mucking they are already known to do.)</p>\n<p>Another avenue is a variant on <a href=\"http://nmap.org/book/idlescan.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">idle scanning</a>, which takes advantage of predictable TCP IPID patterns: send a packet directly to the bridge to learn its current IPID, then instruct some computer in-country to send a packet, and then send another packet directly to find the new IPID and learn whether or not the in-country packet arrived.</p>\n<p>What other services can be bent to our will? Can we advertise the bridge address on a bittorrent tracker that's popular in China and see whether anybody connects? Much creative research remains here.</p>\n<p><strong>Putting it all together</strong></p>\n<p>One of the puzzle pieces holding us back from rolling out the \"tens of thousands of bridge addresses offered by volunteers with spare net blocks\" plan is that we need better ways to get feedback on when addresses get blocked. The ideas in this blog post hopefully provide a good framework for thinking about the problem.</p>\n<p>For the short term, we should deploy a basic TCP connection scanner from inside several censoring countries (China, Iran, and Syria come to mind). Since the \"clients report\" passive strategy still has some open research questions, we should get all our hints from the \"bridges report\" passive strategy. As we're ramping up, and especially since our current bridges are either not blocked at all (outside China), or mostly blocked (inside China), we should feel free to do more thorough active scans to get a better intuition about what scanning can teach us. </p>\n<p>In the long term, I want to use these various building blocks in a feedback loop to identify and reward successful bridge distribution strategies, as outlined in Levchenko and McCoy's <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#proximax11\" rel=\"nofollow\">FC 2011 paper</a>.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we need these four building blocks:</p>\n<p>1) A way to discover how much use a bridge is seeing from a given country. Done: see the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/papers/wecsr10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">WECSR10 paper</a> and <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html#bridge-users\" rel=\"nofollow\">usage graphs</a>.</p>\n<p>2) A way to get fresh bridge addresses over time. The more addresses we can churn through, the more aggressive we can be in experimenting with novel distribution approaches. See <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses\" rel=\"nofollow\">the \"more bridge addresses\" blog post</a> for directions here.</p>\n<p>3) A way to discover when a bridge is blocked in a given country. That's what this blog post is about.</p>\n<p>4) Distribution strategies that rely on different mechanisms to make enumeration difficult. Beyond our \"https\" and \"gmail\" distribution strategies, we know a variety of people in censored countries, and we can think of each of these people as a distribution channel.</p>\n<p>We can define the <em>efficiency</em> of a bridge address in terms of how many people use it and how long before it gets blocked. So a bridge that gets blocked very quickly scores a low efficiency, a bridge that doesn't get blocked but doesn't see much use scores a medium efficiency, and a popular bridge that doesn't get blocked scores high. We can characterize the efficiency of a distribution channel as a function of the efficiency of the bridges it distributes. The key insight is that we then adapt how many new bridges we give to each distribution channel based on its efficiency. So channels that are working well automatically get more addresses to give out, and channels that aren't working well automatically end up with fewer addresses.</p>\n<p>Of course, there's more to it than that. For example, we need to consider how to handle the presence of bridge enumeration attacks that work independently of which distribution channel a given bridge address was given to. We also need to consider attacks that artificially inflate the efficiency of bridges (and thus make us overreward distribution channels), or that learn about a bridge but choose not to block it. But that, as they say, is a story for another time.</p>"

Bridges<br />\n      still need at least one IPv4 address in order to connect to<br />\n      other relays. Note that we don't yet handle the case where the<br />\n      user has two bridge lines for the same bridge (one IPv4, one<br />\n      IPv6). Implements parts of proposal 186.</li>\n<li>New \"DisableNetwork\" config option to prevent Tor from launching any<br />\n      connections or accepting any connections except on a control port.<br />\n      Bundles and controllers can set this option before letting Tor talk<br />\n      to the rest of the network, for example to prevent any connections<br />\n      to a non-bridge address. Packages like Orbot can also use this<br />\n      option to instruct Tor to save power when the network is off.</li>\n<li>Clients and bridges can now be configured to use a separate<br />\n      \"transport\" proxy. This approach makes the censorship arms race<br />\n      easier by allowing bridges to use protocol obfuscation plugins. It<br />\n      implements the \"managed proxy\" part of proposal 180 (ticket 3472).</li>\n<li>When using OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later, use OpenSSL's counter mode<br />\n      implementation. It makes AES_CTR about 7% faster than our old one<br />\n      (which was about 10% faster than the one OpenSSL used to provide).<br />\n      Resolves ticket 4526.</li>\n<li>Add a \"tor2web mode\" for clients that want to connect to hidden<br />\n      services non-anonymously (and possibly more quickly). As a safety<br />\n      measure to try to keep users from turning this on without knowing<br />\n      what they are doing, tor2web mode must be explicitly enabled at<br />\n      compile time, and a copy of Tor compiled to run in tor2web mode<br />\n      cannot be used as a normal Tor client. Implements feature 2553.</li>\n<li>Add experimental support for running on Windows with IOCP and no<br />\n      kernel-space socket buffers. This feature is controlled by a new<br />\n      \"UserspaceIOCPBuffers\" config option (off by default), which has<br />\n      no effect unless Tor has been built with support for bufferevents,<br />\n      is running on Windows, and has enabled IOCP. This may, in the long<br />\n      run, help solve or mitigate bug 98.</li>\n<li>Use a more secure consensus parameter voting algorithm. Now at<br />\n      least three directory authorities or a majority of them must<br />\n      vote on a given parameter before it will be included in the<br />\n      consensus. Implements proposal 178.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Major bugfixes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Hidden services now ignore the timestamps on INTRODUCE2 cells.<br />\n      They used to check that the timestamp was within 30 minutes<br />\n      of their system clock, so they could cap the size of their<br />\n      replay-detection cache, but that approach unnecessarily refused<br />\n      service to clients with wrong clocks. Bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha, when<br />\n      the v3 intro-point protocol (the first one which sent a timestamp<br />\n      field in the INTRODUCE2 cell) was introduced; fixes bug 3460.</li>\n<li>Only use the EVP interface when AES acceleration is enabled,<br />\n      to avoid a 5-7% performance regression. Resolves issue 4525;<br />\n      bugfix on 0.2.3.8-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Privacy/anonymity features (bridge detection):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Make bridge SSL certificates a bit more stealthy by using random<br />\n      serial numbers, in the same fashion as OpenSSL when generating<br />\n      self-signed certificates. Implements ticket 4584.</li>\n<li>Introduce a new config option \"DynamicDHGroups\", enabled by<br />\n      default, which provides each bridge with a unique prime DH modulus<br />\n      to be used during SSL handshakes. This option attempts to help<br />\n      against censors who might use the Apache DH modulus as a static<br />\n      identifier for bridges. Addresses ticket 4548.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features (new/different config options):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>New configuration option \"DisableDebuggerAttachment\" (on by default)<br />\n      to prevent basic debugging attachment attempts by other processes.<br />\n      Supports Mac OS X and Gnu/Linux. Resolves ticket 3313.</li>\n<li>Allow MapAddress directives to specify matches against super-domains,<br />\n      as in \"MapAddress *.torproject.org *.torproject.org.torserver.exit\".<br />\n      Implements issue 933.</li>\n<li>Slightly change behavior of \"list\" options (that is, config<br />\n      options that can appear more than once) when they appear both in<br />\n      torrc and on the command line. Previously, the command-line options<br />\n      would be appended to the ones from torrc. Now, the command-line<br />\n      options override the torrc options entirely. This new behavior<br />\n      allows the user to override list options (like exit policies and<br />\n      ports to listen on) from the command line, rather than simply<br />\n      appending to the list.</li>\n<li>You can get the old (appending) command-line behavior for \"list\"<br />\n      options by prefixing the option name with a \"+\".</li>\n<li>You can remove all the values for a \"list\" option from the command<br />\n      line without adding any new ones by prefixing the option name<br />\n      with a \"/\".</li>\n<li>Add experimental support for a \"defaults\" torrc file to be parsed<br />\n      before the regular torrc. Torrc options override the defaults file's<br />\n      options in the same way that the command line overrides the torrc.<br />\n      The SAVECONF controller command saves only those options which<br />\n      differ between the current configuration and the defaults file. HUP<br />\n      reloads both files. (Note: This is an experimental feature; its<br />\n      behavior will probably be refined in future 0.2.3.x-alpha versions<br />\n      to better meet packagers' needs.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor features:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to make the introductory warning message that Tor prints on<br />\n      startup more useful for actually finding help and information.<br />\n      Resolves ticket 2474.</li>\n<li>Running \"make version\" now displays the version of Tor that<br />\n      we're about to build. Idea from katmagic; resolves issue 4400.</li>\n<li>Expire old or over-used hidden service introduction points.<br />\n      Required by fix for bug 3460.</li>\n<li>Move the replay-detection cache for the RSA-encrypted parts of<br />\n      INTRODUCE2 cells to the introduction point data structures.<br />\n      Previously, we would use one replay-detection cache per hidden<br />\n      service. Required by fix for bug 3460.</li>\n<li>Reduce the lifetime of elements of hidden services' Diffie-Hellman<br />\n      public key replay-detection cache from 60 minutes to 5 minutes. This<br />\n      replay-detection cache is now used only to detect multiple<br />\n      INTRODUCE2 cells specifying the same rendezvous point, so we can<br />\n      avoid launching multiple simultaneous attempts to connect to it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on Tor 0.2.2.x and earlier):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Resolve an integer overflow bug in smartlist_ensure_capacity().<br />\n      Fixes bug 4230; bugfix on Tor 0.1.0.1-rc. Based on a patch by<br />\n      Mansour Moufid.</li>\n<li>Fix a minor formatting issue in one of tor-gencert's error messages.<br />\n      Fixes bug 4574.</li>\n<li>Prevent a false positive from the check-spaces script, by disabling<br />\n      the \"whitespace between function name and (\" check for functions<br />\n      named 'op()'.</li>\n<li>Fix a log message suggesting that people contact a non-existent<br />\n      email address. Fixes bug 3448.</li>\n<li>Fix null-pointer access that could occur if TLS allocation failed.<br />\n      Fixes bug 4531; bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc. Found by \"troll_un\".</li>\n<li>Report a real bootstrap problem to the controller on router<br />\n      identity mismatch. Previously we just said \"foo\", which probably<br />\n      made a lot of sense at the time. Fixes bug 4169; bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.1.1-alpha.</li>\n<li>If we had ever tried to call tor_addr_to_str() on an address of<br />\n      unknown type, we would have done a strdup() on an uninitialized<br />\n      buffer. Now we won't. Fixes bug 4529; bugfix on 0.2.1.3-alpha.<br />\n      Reported by \"troll_un\".</li>\n<li>Correctly detect and handle transient lookup failures from<br />\n      tor_addr_lookup(). Fixes bug 4530; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.<br />\n      Reported by \"troll_un\".</li>\n<li>Use tor_socket_t type for listener argument to accept(). Fixes bug<br />\n      4535; bugfix on 0.2.2.28-beta. Found by \"troll_un\".</li>\n<li>Initialize conn-&gt;addr to a valid state in spawn_cpuworker(). Fixes<br />\n      bug 4532; found by \"troll_un\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes (on Tor 0.2.3.x):</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a compile warning in tor_inet_pton().

Diagnosed<br />\n      with help from wanoskarnet.</li>\n<li>Restore behavior of overriding SocksPort, ORPort, and similar<br />\n      options from the command line. Bugfix on 0.2.3.3-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Build fixes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Properly handle the case where the build-tree is not the same<br />\n      as the source tree when generating src/common/common_sha1.i,<br />\n      src/or/micro-revision.i, and src/or/or_sha1.i. Fixes bug 3953;<br />\n      bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Code simplifications, cleanups, and refactorings:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Remove the pure attribute from all functions that used it<br />\n      previously. In many cases we assigned it incorrectly, because the<br />\n      functions might assert or call impure functions, and we don't have<br />\n      evidence that keeping the pure attribute is worthwhile. Implements<br />\n      changes suggested in ticket 4421.</li>\n<li>Remove some dead code spotted by coverity. Fixes cid 432.<br />\n      Bugfix on 0.2.3.1-alpha, closes bug 4637.</li>\n</ul>"

Those Tor versions have many known flaws, and<br />\n  nobody should be using them. You should upgrade -- ideally to the<br />\n  0.2.2.x series.

Fixes CVE-2011-2778;<br />\n      bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Reported by \"Vektor\".</li>\n<li>Initialize Libevent with the EVENT_BASE_FLAG_NOLOCK flag enabled, so<br />\n      that it doesn't attempt to allocate a socketpair. This could cause<br />\n      some problems on Windows systems with overzealous firewalls. Fix for<br />\n      bug 4457; workaround for Libevent versions 2.0.1-alpha through<br />\n      2.0.15-stable.</li>\n<li>If we mark an OR connection for close based on a cell we process,<br />\n      don't process any further cells on it. We already avoid further<br />\n      reads on marked-for-close connections, but now we also discard the<br />\n      cells we'd already read.

Bug discovered by Dan Rosenberg. Fixes bug 4410;<br />\n      bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.</li>\n<li>Fix a memory leak when we check whether a hidden service<br />\n      descriptor has any usable introduction points left. Fixes bug<br />\n      4424. Bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.</li>\n<li>Don't crash when we're running as a relay and don't have a GeoIP<br />\n      file. Bugfix on 0.2.2.34; fixes bug 4340. This backports a fix<br />\n      we've had in the 0.2.3.x branch already.</li>\n<li>When running as a client, do not print a misleading (and plain<br />\n      wrong) log message that we're collecting \"directory request\"<br />\n      statistics: clients don't collect statistics. Also don't create a<br />\n      useless (because empty) stats file in the stats/ directory. Fixes<br />\n      bug 4353; bugfix on 0.2.2.34.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Minor bugfixes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Detect failure to initialize Libevent.

This was eating up hideously large amounts of time on some<br />\n      busy servers.

Fixes bug 4331;<br />\n      bugfix on 0.2.2.23-alpha; found by \"tmpname0901\".</li>\n<li>Fix a memory leak in launch_direct_bridge_descriptor_fetch() that<br />\n      occurred when a client tried to fetch a descriptor for a bridge<br />\n      in ExcludeNodes. Fixes bug 4383; bugfix on 0.2.2.25-alpha.</li>\n<li>Backport fixes for a pair of compilation warnings on Windows.<br />\n      Fixes bug 4521; bugfix on 0.2.2.28-beta and on 0.2.2.29-beta.</li>\n<li>If we had ever tried to call tor_addr_to_str on an address of<br />\n      unknown type, we would have done a strdup on an uninitialized<br />\n      buffer.

Now it will be easier for researchers to simulate<br />\n      Tor networks with different values. Resolves ticket 4484.</li>\n<li>When Tor ignores a hidden service specified in its configuration,<br />\n      include the hidden service's directory in the warning message.<br />\n      Previously, we would only tell the user that some hidden service<br />\n      was ignored.

    "content": "<p>Greetings!  My name is Tim Wilde, Software Engineer at Team Cymru, Inc., and a big fan of the Tor Project and everything that they do.  We've helped out the Tor Project with a few investigations into probing/blocking of Tor by oppressive regimes, and the guys asked me to write this one up for the Tor Blog, so here I am!  Note: any opinions expressed here are mine, nor those of Team Cymru or the Tor Project.</p>\n<p>In October 2011, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4185\" rel=\"nofollow\">ticket #4185</a> was filed in the Tor bug tracker by a user in China who found that their connections to US-based Tor bridge relays were being regularly cut off after a very short period of time.  At the time we performed some basic experimentation and discovered that Chinese IPs (presumably at the behest of the Great Firewall of China, or GFW) would reach out to the US-based bridge and connect to it shortly after the Tor user in China connected, and, if successful, shortly thereafter the connection would be blocked by the GFW.  There wasn't time for a detailed investigation and analysis at the time, but that kernel eventually grew into the investigation detailed below.  We were, however, able to determine that limiting connections to the bridge relay to only the single IP expected to be its client would, in fact, block the probes and allow the connection to remain open for an extended period (&gt;48 hours in our testing).</p>\n<p>Between 05 DEC and 09 DEC 2011, we undertook a detailed and methodical investigation into probing and blocking of Tor connections originating within China.  Unfortunately for our analysis, it appears that the GFW's active blocking of connections to Tor bridges had stopped, but we were still able to gather valuable data about the probing performed by the GFW, which previously led directly and verifiably to blocking.</p>\n<p>To this end we discovered two types of probing.  First, \"garbage binary\" probes, containing nothing more than arbitrary (but sometimes repeated in later probes) binary data, were experienced by the non-China side of any connection that originated from China to TCP port 443 (HTTPS) in which an SSL negotiation was performed.  This probe was performed in near-real-time after the connection was established, implying near-line-rate deep packet inspection (DPI) capabilities.  TCP/443 connections not performing an SSL handshake, such as using the obfsproxy obfs2 protocol or a plain-text protocol, did not provoke probing.  The purpose of these probes is unknown, and further investigation is difficult to justify when it seems relatively clear that these probes are not aimed at Tor.</p>\n<p>The second type of probe, on the other hand, is aimed quite directly at Tor.  When a Tor client within China connected to a US-based bridge relay, we consistently found that at the next round 15 minute interval (HH:00, HH:15, HH:30, HH:45), the bridge relay would receive a probe from hosts within China that not only established a TCP connection, but performed an SSL negotiation, an SSL renegotiation, and then spoke the Tor protocol sufficiently to build a one-hop circuit and send a BEGIN_DIR cell.  No matter what TCP port the bridge was listening on, once a Tor client from China connected, within 3 minutes of the next 15 minute interval we saw a series of probes including at least one connection speaking the Tor protocol.</p>\n<p>The good news is, we were able to isolate which characteristic of the Tor handshake the GFW was using to decide whether or not to initiate these probes.  By making a simple change to the list of supported SSL ciphers in the \"hello\" packet sent by the Tor client within China, we were able to prevent the probes from taking place.  This has been documented and is being discussed in <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4744\" rel=\"nofollow\">ticket #4744</a>.  This differs slightly from the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-blocks-tor-tor-releases-same-day-fix\" rel=\"nofollow\">method used by Iran to block Tor in September 2011</a>, using the client-side of the SSL negotiation as its trigger rather than the server-side.  It is likely, however, that technology capable of targeting either side of the connection to this degree could also target the other side, so it remains important to consider both the server and client sides of the Tor connection when attempting to blend in with normal, benign traffic.</p>\n<p>The bad news, however, is that this is happening at all.  This probe again implies sophisticated near-line-rate DPI technology, coupled with a system that is aimed directly at Tor, using code that actually speaks the Tor protocol.  Clearly there is a target painted firmly on Tor, and it is quite likely that the Chinese will continue to adapt their censorship technology as the Tor Project adapts to them.</p>\n<p>There is light at the end of the tunnel, though.  A number of ideas have been put forward about new protocols, handshakes, and extensions to the Tor protocol that could be used to combat this type of censorship technology in a more long-term-sustainable way.  <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/190-password-bridge-authorization.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">Proposal 190</a> provides for password authorization for bridge relays.  <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/tor-obfs-howto.txt\" rel=\"nofollow\">obfsproxy</a> provides an extra layer on top of a Tor connection that makes it look like generic binary data.  The Tor v3 link protocol/handshake, currently available and in testing in the 0.2.3.x-alpha series of Tor releases, eliminates SSL renegotiation in Tor session establishment, removing one of Tor's current \"sore thumbs\" that stick out from normal HTTPS SSL traffic.</p>\n<p>You're welcome to check out my <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/da3c7a9af01d74cd7de7\" rel=\"nofollow\">full report on this investigation</a> for more detail than I could provide in the blog post here.  Thanks very much to everyone who assisted with the investigation and the report!  It was fun to investigate and report on this, and I hope to have the opportunity to help out with similar adventures in the future.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Getting good stories for Tor successes is tricky, because if Tor is doing its job, nobody notices. I know a lot of people who have really interesting Tor success stories and have no interest in telling the world who they are and how they managed (until that moment when everybody is reading about them, that is) to stay safe.</p>\n<p>Still, there are a bunch of other stories out there that haven't been documented as well. For example, I really like Nasser's story about his experiences in Mauritania:<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/22427/page4/\" title=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/22427/page4/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/22427/page4/</a></p>\n<p>Hidden services have gotten less broad attention from the Tor user base, since most people who install Tor have a website in mind like twitter or indymedia that they want to visit safely. Some good use cases that we've seen for hidden services in particular include:</p>\n<p>- I know people (for example, in countries that have been undergoing revolutions lately) who run popular blogs but their blogs kept getting knocked offline by state-sponsored jerks. The common blogging software they used (like Wordpress) couldn't stand up to the ddos attacks and breakins. The solution was to split the blog into a public side, which is static html and has no logins, and a private side for posting, which is only reachable over a Tor hidden service. Now their blog works again and they're reaching their audiences. And as a bonus, the nice fellow hosting the private side for them doesn't need to let people know where it is, and even if somebody figures it out, the nice fellow hosting it doesn't have any IP addresses to hand over or lose.</p>\n<p>- Whistleblowing websites want to provide documents from a platform that is hard for upset corporations or governments to censor. See e.g. <a href=\"http://globaleaks.org/\" title=\"http://globaleaks.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://globaleaks.org/</a></p>\n<p>- Google for 'indymedia fbi seize'. When Indymedia offers a hidden service version of their website, censoring organizations don't know which data centers to bully into handing over the hardware.</p>\n<p>- Data retention laws in Europe (and soon in the US too at this rate) threaten to make centralized chat networks vulnerable to social network analysis (step one, collect all the data; step two, get broken into by corporations, criminals, external governments, you name it; step three comes identity theft, stalking, targeted scam jobs, etc etc). What if you had a chat network where all the users were on hidden services by default? Now there's no easy central point to learn who's talking to who and when. Building one and making it usable turns out to be hard. But good thing we have this versatile tool here as a building block.</p>\n<p>That's a start. It is certainly the case that we (Tor) spend most of our time making the technology better, and not so much of our time figuring out how to market it and change the world's perception on whether being safe online is worthwhile. Please help. :)</p>\n<p>You might also like<br />\n<a href=\"https://torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en\" title=\"https://torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/we-need-your-good-tor-stories\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/we-need-your-good-tor-stories\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/we-need-your-good-tor-stories</a></p>\n<p>This blog post was adapted from an email to tor-talk by Roger.

But SOPA and PIPA (the House's \"Stop Online Piracy Act\" and the Senate's \"Protect-IP Act\") go beyond enforcement of copyright. These copyright bills would strain the infrastructure of the Internet, on which many free communications -- anonymous or identified -- depend.  Originally, the bills proposed that so-called \"rogue sites\" should be blocked through the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS). That would have broken DNSSEC security and shared U.S. censorship tactics with those of China's \"great firewall.\"</p>\n<p>Now, while we hear that DNS-blocking is off the table, the bills remain threatening to the network of intermediaries who carry online speech. Most critically to Tor, SOPA contained a provision forbidding \"circumvention\" of court-ordered blocking that was written broadly enough that it <a href=\"http://wendy.seltzer.org/blog/archives/2011/12/15/stopping-sopas-anti-circumvention.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">could apply to Tor</a> -- which helps its users to \"circumvent\" local-network censorship.  Further, both bills broaden the reach of intermediary liability, to hold conduits and search engines liable for user-supplied infringement. The private rights of action and \"safe harbors\" could force or encourage providers to censor well beyond the current DMCA's \"notice and takedown\" provision (of which <a href=\"https://www.chillingeffects.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chilling Effects</a> documents numerous burdens and abuses).</p>\n<p>On January 18, we're joining <a href=\"https://blog.wikimedia.org/2012/01/16/wikipedias-community-calls-for-anti-sopa-blackout-january-18/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wikipedia</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reddit</a>, the <a href=\"http://blog.media.mit.edu/2012/01/media-lab-is-against-sopa-and-pipa.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MIT Media Lab</a>, and <a href=\"http://americancensorship.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">hundreds of others</a> in protest, turning a portion of the Tor site black to call attention to copyright balance and remind the US Congress and voters of the value of the open Internet.  </p>\n<p>U.S. citizens, please call or write, to <a href=\"http://americancensorship.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">urge your representatives to stop SOPA and PIPA</a>.

In the words of William Gibson, <em>\"The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed\"</em>. Restrictions on the right to read though the Internet perfectly match this observation. A lot should be said about perceptions of censorship, and it is often thought that places like Syria or Iran are unique.

This probably holds a lot of truth but it absolutely fails to address the core of the issue &mdash; these countries and those networks are not unique.</p>\n<p>In fact, we find uncensored networks to almost be an abnormal state.

This is enabled by default without user's affirmative consent and only savvy privileged users may even attempt to disable this censorship. There is an <a href=\"http://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-2144\" rel=\"nofollow\">informational page about the T-Mobile censorship system</a> and it explains that this censorship may be disabled. We've heard reports that attempts to disable the censorship are not always successful and this certainly doesn't bode well for an easy and censorship-free Internet experience.</p>\n<p>The T-Mobile USA network censorship appears to be simple to bypass: it appears to only trigger when a client sends Host: torproject.org on TCP port 80 and visitors that use <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">HTTPS</a> will probably not notice or be obviously impacted by their censorship.</p>\n<p>This kind of censorship raises all kinds of interesting questions. I suspect it raises US legal  and social questions as well. The Tor Project is a registered 501c3 non-profit corporation in the state of Massachusetts, and the block was experienced in California. Does this count as interfering with interstate commerce? What duty of care does T-Mobile USA have when it relies on systems or infrastructure funded by the public? What duty of care do they have as a common carrier?</p>\n<p>Similarly, when a user on the UK Vodafone network visits <a href=\"http://www.torproject.org/\" title=\"http://www.torproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.torproject.org/</a> they are greeted by <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/www.torproject.org-vodafone.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">a block page as well</a>. You can visit this <a href=\"http://online.vodafone.co.uk/dispatch/Portal/ContentControlServlet?type=restricted\" rel=\"nofollow\">block page</a> without directly using their networks. Detecting their filters is straightforward and we see tampering at the sixth hop.</p>\n<p>Here is a tcptraceroute to TCP port 80 of torproject.org from an Ubuntu machine connected to the Internet via Vodafone UK:<br />\n<code><br />\nTracing the path to <a href=\"http://www.torproject.org\" title=\"www.torproject.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.torproject.org</a> (86.59.30.36) on TCP port 80 (www), 30 hops max<br />\n 1  192.168.1.1  2.379 ms  1.011 ms  1.313 ms<br />\n 2  10.252.225.61  90.998 ms  133.672 ms  95.963 ms<br />\n 3  10.252.224.186  78.865 ms  91.722 ms  91.415 ms<br />\n 4  * * *<br />\n 5  10.203.64.130  88.502 ms  73.259 ms  80.765 ms<br />\n 6  <a href=\"http://www.torproject.org\" title=\"www.torproject.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.torproject.org</a> (86.59.30.36) [open]  77.927 ms  152.599 ms  96.399 ms<br />\n</code></p>\n<p>Here is a normal traceroute to torproject.org from an Ubuntu machine connected to the internet via Vodafone UK:<br />\n<code><br />\ntraceroute to <a href=\"http://www.torproject.org\" title=\"www.torproject.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.torproject.org</a> (86.59.30.36), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets<br />\n 1  192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)  9.669 ms  9.583 ms  9.460 ms<br />\n 2  10.252.225.61 (10.252.225.61)  98.084 ms  98.046 ms  98.224 ms<br />\n 3  10.252.224.219 (10.252.224.219)  98.760 ms  109.326 ms  109.261 ms<br />\n 4  host203.msm.che.vodafone (10.203.64.154)  109.087 ms  127.554 ms  127.426 ms<br />\n 5  * * *<br />\n 6  * * *<br />\n 7  * * *<br />\n 8  * * *<br />\n 9  85.205.0.110 (85.205.0.110)  180.920 ms  180.692 ms  180.652 ms<br />\n10  85.205.0.109 (85.205.0.109)  180.659 ms  180.473 ms *<br />\n11  85.205.116.5 (85.205.116.5)  260.480 ms * 85.205.116.1 (85.205.116.1) 152.107 ms<br />\n12  92.79.213.157 (92.79.213.157)  152.265 ms  152.099 ms  151.808 ms<br />\n13  92.79.209.210 (92.79.209.210)  151.453 ms  151.124 ms 92.79.203.254 (92.79.203.254)  151.129 ms<br />\n14  vin-145-254-19-130.arcor-ip.net (145.254.19.130)  157.978 ms vin-145-254-19-126.arcor-ip.net (145.254.19.126)  119.699 ms  129.820 ms<br />\n15  te3-1-vix-iec-c2.ix.sil.at (193.203.0.6)  129.999 ms  136.314 ms  136.338 ms<br />\n16  86.59.118.145 (86.59.118.145)  136.033 ms  135.826 ms  135.666 ms<br />\n17  <a href=\"http://www.torproject.org\" title=\"www.torproject.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.torproject.org</a> (86.59.30.36)  151.282 ms  118.185 ms  114.603 ms<br />\n</code></p>\n<p>We've additionally found that pre-paid T-Mobile UK accounts also experience censorship that is similar to T-Mobile USA.

This is an attack against users who attempt to connect to our infrastructure. This attack, while primitive, demonstrates an active and malicious action on the part of the above named Internet providers.</p>\n<p>We've additionally seen reports of the UK O2 network blocking connections to <a href=\"http://www.torproject.org/\" title=\"http://www.torproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.torproject.org/</a> in exactly the same way that Vodafone UK blocks access. The O2 filter has been covered in the <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-03/04/o2-mobile-web-filtering\" rel=\"nofollow\">popular media in the recent past</a> and we're sad to hear that they've decided to include Tor's website in their race to the bottom.</p>\n<p>In all the above cases we do not see DNS tampering but rather outright <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\" rel=\"nofollow\">Man-In-The-Middle attacks</a> against connections to our web server. These censorship systems do not currently implement a Man-In-The-Middle attack against the SSL services offered by our web server. It is not much of a stretch of the imagination to think that such an action may be a future plan; we've <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/detecting-certificate-authority-compromises-and-web-browser-collusion\" rel=\"nofollow\">seen</a> it <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-damage-disclosure\" rel=\"nofollow\">elsewhere</a>.</p>\n<p>Current users of the Tor network are not impacted by this filtering, but these networks are attempting to deny new users the ability to start using Tor without extensive efforts. You can <a href=\"https://bango.net/O2AV/wUnsuccessful.aspx?action=sessionTimeout&amp;httpsRedirect=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">view their filter page</a> without using their service; the <a href=\"https://bango.net/O2AV/mUnsuccessful.aspx?action=noMSISDN&amp;httpsRedirect=1&amp;httpsRedirect=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">exact block page</a> is also available externally. It appears that it is possible for users to disable this censorship by providing a credit card as a proof of age. This is not exactly a privacy-friendly tactic. The O2 Twitter account <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/O2/status/159560963106947072\" rel=\"nofollow\">contacted me</a> and said they were willing to review their censorship policy for torproject.org but they did not offer to remove the censorship entirely.</p>\n<p>This trend of providing partially censored Internet in what we all think of as free countries is alarming. Are we supposed to look the other way because the mobile Internet isn't the same as the \"real\" Internet? Should we worry that Vodafone's capabilities and behavior here remind us of <a href=\"http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2011/01/28/vodafone-confirms-role-egypts-cellular-internet-blackout/\" rel=\"nofollow\">what they did in Egypt last year</a>?

    "content": "<p>Over the past two days we've been hearing from, and working with, a number of Iranians having difficulty using Tor from inside Iran. It seems the Iranian government has ramped up censorship in three ways:  deep packet inspection (dpi) of SSL traffic, selective blocking of IP Address and TCP port combinations, and some keyword filtering. For instance, they have partially blocked access to Tor's website, torproject.org, via IP address (such as 86.59.30.36) and port 443 (which is the HTTPS port). The third level of blocking is by keywords, such as searching for the word 'tor' via regular, non-encrypted search engine websites.</p>\n<p>The blocks on SSL are not complete and not nationwide. Where blocking is in place, initial investigations show they are identifying the beginning of the SSL handshake and simply interrupting the handshake. We continue to research and investigate solutions with the assumption that SSL will eventually be blocked nationwide inside Iran. Our goal is to defeat their dpi signatures and allow tor to work by default.</p>\n<p>The Iran Media Program has <a href=\"http://iranmediaresearch.com/en/blog/101/12/02/09/840\" rel=\"nofollow\">posted their thoughts</a> on what is happening from a journalist's perspective.</p>\n<p>So far, it seems the majority of Tor users are not affected by these blocks.

    "content": "<p>On Feb&nbsp;9, Iran <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-partially-blocks-encrypted-network-traffic\">started to filter SSL connections</a> on much of their network. Since the Tor protocol uses SSL, that means Tor stopped working too &mdash; even Tor with bridges, since bridges use SSL too.</p>\n<p>We've been quietly developing Obfsproxy, a new tool to make it easier to change how Tor traffic looks on the network. In late 2011 Iran <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/~karsten/volatile/top-3-direct-users-relative-2011-12-13.png\">moved into the #2 position</a> in global Tor user count, and several important political events are scheduled in Iran this month and next. This situation seemed like a good time to test our new tool while also helping improve Internet freedom around the world.</p>\n<p>We started with a \"Tor Obfsproxy Browser Bundle\" with two test obfsproxy bridges in it, to verify that it worked in-country.  Then we got over 300 volunteers running more obfsproxy bridges (even with our <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy-instructions.html.en\">complex build instructions</a>!), and picked fourteen fast stable trustworthy obfsproxy bridges for an updated bundle which we put out the morning of Feb&nbsp;11. We spent the weekend fixing usability, stability, and scalability bugs, and put out <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy#download\">another bundle</a> on Feb&nbsp;13 with new versions of Vidalia, Tor, and Obfsproxy.</p>\n<p>Thousands of people in Iran successfully used the Obfsproxy Bundle over the weekend:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.torproject.org/files/obfsproxy-usage-2012-02-15-4.png\" alt=\"Obfsproxy users in Iran\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<p>We did some spot-checking and it seems that the new addresses on Feb&nbsp;14 are mostly different from the new addresses on Feb&nbsp;13; but I would guess these are mostly returning users with dynamic IP addresses, rather than actually fresh users. More importantly, these people will be thinking about Obfsproxy next time the filter cracks down &mdash; and based on current events, that next time won't be far off. Finally, even though it looks like <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=direct-users&amp;start=2012-01-12&amp;end=2012-02-16&amp;country=ir&amp;events=on&amp;dpi=72#direct-users\">SSL and Tor are back</a>, I expect Iran will keep throttling SSL traffic as they've been doing for months, so the Obfsproxy bundle will still be more fun to use in Iran than the normal Tor bundles.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>\n<p>Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) algorithms classify Internet traffic by protocol. That is, they look at a given traffic flow and decide whether it's http, ssl, bittorrent, vpn, etc. Governments like Iran, China, and Syria increasingly use these tools (and they often purchase them from Western corporations, but <a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/video/28c3-4800-en-how_governments_have_tried_to_block_tor_h264.mp4\">that's a different story</a>) to implement their country-wide censorship, either by looking for a given protocol and outright blocking it, or by more subtle mechanisms like squeezing down the bandwidth available to a given protocol to discourage its use.</p>\n<p>Obfsproxy's role is to make it easy for Tor's traffic flows to look like whatever we like. This way Tor can focus on security and anonymity, and Obfsproxy can focus on appearance. The first thing we decided to try looking like was nothing at all: the \"obfs2\" module adds an encryption wrapper around Tor's traffic, using a <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs2/protocol-spec.txt\">handshake</a> that has no recognizable byte patterns.</p>\n<p>It won't work perfectly. For example, the traffic flows will still have recognizable timing, volume, and packet size characteristics; a good entropy test would show that the handshake looks way more random than most handshakes; and the censors could always press the \"only allow protocols my DPI box recognizes\" panic button. Each step in this arms race aims to force the censor to a) put more development time and DPI resources into examining flows, and b) risk more false positives, that is, risk blocking innocent users that they didn't realize they'd be blocking.</p>\n<p>This particular new obfuscating layer isn't the most important feature of Obfsproxy. The best part is that makes it easy to design, deploy, and test other obfuscating layers without messing with the rest of Tor. There's a lot of research into trying to make traffic flows look like other protocols, so for example we could rewrite the Tor flows as valid http that the DPI engine considers harmless. That problem is harder than it sounds &mdash; and it sounds hard. But by making a separate component that only has to worry about how the traffic looks, other researchers can try out different strategies without needing to learn so much about the rest of Tor. This approach will also let us easily <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/180-pluggable-transport.txt\">plug in other transports</a> like <a href=\"https://telex.cc/\">Telex</a>, and it will also let <strong><em>other</em></strong> circumvention projects reuse Obfsproxy so they don't have to reinvent our wheels.</p>\n<p><strong>Moving forward</strong></p>\n<p>One of the choices we faced was how widely and loudly to mention the bundle. While we think it would be hard and/or risky for attackers to block the Obfsproxy <em>protocol</em>, the bundle included 14 preconfigured bridge addresses, and censors could just plug those addresses into their blacklists. We started the weekend telling people to only tell their close friends, but on Sunday we opted for a broader publicity push inside the activist community for two reasons. First, the new Vidalia release (0.2.17) lets users configure their own obfsproxy bridge addresses, so if the preconfigured addresses get blocked the user can just put in new ones. Second, it became clearer that the blocking would let up in a few days once the immediate political pressure was over, and we decided it was more important to get the word out about Obfsproxy in general so these users will know about it next time.</p>\n<p>I should point out that I don't think they were targeting Tor here. They were targeting popular websites that use SSL, like Gmail and Facebook.  Tor was collateral damage because we opted to make Tor traffic look like SSL. That said, we should not forget that we are on their radar: they <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/iran-blocks-tor-tor-releases-same-day-fix\">targeted Tor by DPI in September 2011</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.nu.nl/internet/2603449/mogelijk-nepsoftware-verspreid-naast-aftappen-gmail.html\">Diginotar breakin</a> obtained a fake SSL cert for torproject.org.</p>\n<p>The next choice we face is: what other communities should we tell? The bundle works great in China too, where their aggressive censorship has been <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/knock-knock-knockin-bridges-doors\">a real hassle</a> for us the past year or so. Some other countries in Asia appear to be newly using DPI to recognize Tor traffic (more on that in an upcoming blog post). We have more development work to do before we can keep up with the China arms race, including teaching obfsproxy bridges to automatically report their addresses to us and teaching our <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/\">bridgedb service</a> to give them out, and we need to answer research questions around <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses\">getting more bridges</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bridge-distribution-strategies\">giving them out in smarter ways</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-five-ways-test-bridge-reachability\">learning when they get blocked</a>, and <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problems-ten-ways-discover-tor-bridges\">making it hard for censors to find them</a>. We also need to spread the word carefully, since the arms race is as much about <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/press/presskit/2010-09-16-circumvention-features.pdf\">not drawing the attention of the censors</a> as it is about the technology. But the Obfsproxy Bundle works out of the box right now in every censoring country we know of, so we shouldn't be <em>too</em> quiet about it.</p>\n<p>And finally, thanks go to George Kadianakis for taking Obfsproxy on as his <a href=\"http://code.google.com/soc/\">Google Summer of Code 2011</a> <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-April/020234.html\">Project</a>; to Nick Mathewson for mentoring him and getting the Obfsproxy architecture going in the right direction; to Sebastian Hahn for spending all weekend with me fixing bugs and making packages; and to Karsten Loesing, Erinn Clark, Robert Ransom, Runa Sandvik, Nick, George, and the broader Tor community for stepping up over the weekend to help us take it from \"early prototype\" to \"deployed software in use by 5000+ people\" in 72 hours.</p>"

We received a copy of each malware, and Jonathan Tomek from <a href=\"http://threatgrid.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ThreatGRID</a> helped with the analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>How you get infected</strong></p>\n<p>The malicious software is spread as email attachments, and as files sent via Instant Messaging and Skype. The software looks like two completely harmless files; a Microsoft PowerPoint slide show and an image file. The malicious software will silently install itself on your computer when you open one of the files.</p>\n<p>Malicious software, such as the two copies we analyzed, is normally designed to gather sensitive information and gain unauthorized access to a computer system. The seemingly harmless PowerPoint slide show turned out to be a keylogger, while the image file was really a backdoor, providing the attacker with full access to the system.</p>\n<p>Both the keylogger and the backdoor will transfer data to www(dot)meroo(dot)no-ip(dot)org, on port 778. This domain name used to point to a server at a government-owned telecommunications company in Syria, but was later updated to point to a <a href=\"http://www.linode.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Linode</a> server in London, UK. <a href=\"http://www.no-ip.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">No-IP</a> have since pointed the domain name to an invalid IP address (0.0.0.0).</p>\n<p>Most anti-virus software will be able to detect and remove both the <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/file/cef080a347339eb37e7efb33ed458044610946c5af404c5eae06309953111cf5/analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">keylogger</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/file/f64434efd243e1a099ed4dee008286caebfcf407b245f72c5ec59222995702f4/analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow\">backdoor</a>. You may try updating your anti-virus software, running it, and using it to remove the malware if anything pops up. However, the safest course of action is to re-install the operating system on your computer.</p>\n<p>The EFF wrote a blog post called <em><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/03/how-find-syrian-government-malware-your-computer-and-remove-it\" rel=\"nofollow\">How to Find and Protect Yourself Against the Pro-Syrian-Government Malware on Your Computer</a></em>. In the post, they recommend <em>\"that you take steps to protect yourself from being infected by not running any software received through e-mail, not installing software at all except over HTTPS, and not installing software from unfamiliar sources even if recommended by a pop-up ad or a casual recommendation from a friend.\"</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>PowerPoint slide show: keylogger</strong></p>\n<p>When you first try to open the PowerPoint slide show, you will get a security warning asking if you really want to allow this file to run. The <em>Name</em> field points to the following executable file: <em>C:\Program Files\Common Files\VMConvert32\wmccds.exe</em></p>\n<p>If you ignore the warning and click <em>Run</em>, a self-extracting rar file will install the malware (the <em>wmccds</em> executable) onto your computer. The PowerPoint slide show will then open and you will see a series of images and some text in Farsi. The malware will not activate until you reboot your computer.</p>\n<p>The first time you reboot, the malware will activate and start logging your keystrokes. If you are running Windows 7, you will see the same warning as mentioned above, and you have to click <em>Run</em> before the malware is actually activated. Older versions of Windows will not display this warning when you reboot.</p>\n<p>The malware will modify the Windows startup script to ensure that the keylogger is always running when you are using the computer. The keylogger will affect your whole system, and it will even send the contents of your clipboard to the attacker. The Tor Browser Bundle does not protect you if you have a keylogger on your system.</p>\n<p><strong>Windows screen saver: backdoor</strong></p>\n<p>The Windows screen saver contains a type of malware that is a bit more complex than the one described above. When you run the Windows screen saver, it will start an image program and show you a picture (we saw a picture of a rifle, but that is not always the case). Meanwhile, the malicious software installs a backdoor onto your computer and opens a connection to www(dot)meroo(dot)no-ip(dot)org, using port 778.</p>\n<p>The backdoor (<em>1122333.exe</em> in the <em>Documents and Settings</em> folder), which is similar to the DarkComet Remote Administration Tool, allows the attacker to connect to your computer and do anything that he or she wants, including logging keystrokes and acting as the system administrator. The malware will modify the Windows startup script to ensure that the connection is always open.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Although Tor was originally designed to enhance privacy, the network is increasingly being used to provide access to websites from countries where Internet connectivity is filtered. To better support this goal, Tor introduced the feature of <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges\" rel=\"nofollow\">bridge nodes</a> &ndash; Tor nodes which route traffic but are not published in the list of available Tor nodes. Consequently bridges are commonly not blocked in countries where access to the public Tor nodes are (with the exception of China and Iran).</p>\n<p>For bridge nodes to work well, we need lots of them. This is both to make it hard to block them all, and also to provide enough bandwidth capacity for all their users. To help achieve this goal, the Tor Browser Bundle now makes it as easy as clicking a button to turn a normal Tor client into a bridge. The upcoming version of Tor will even set up port forwarding on home routers (through UPnP and NAT-PMP) to make it easier still.</p>\n<p>There are, however, potential risks to Tor users if they turn their client into a bridge. These were summarized in a paper by Jon McLachlan and Nicholas Hopper: <a href=\"http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~hopper/surf_and_serve.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"On the risks of serving whenever you surf\"</a>. I discussed these risks in a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/risks-serving-whenever-you-surf\" rel=\"nofollow\">previous blog post</a>, along with ways to mitigate them. In this blog post I'll cover some initiatives the Tor project is working on (or considering), which could further reduce the risks.</p>\n<p>The attack than McLachlan and Hopper propose involves finding a list of bridges, and then probing them over time. If the bridge responds at all, then we know that the bridge operator could be surfing the web though Tor. So, if the attacker suspects that a blogger is posting through Tor and the blogger's Tor client is also a bridge, then only the bridges which are running at the time a blog post was written could belong to the blogger. There are likely to be quite a few such bridges, but if the attack is repeated, the set of potential bridge IP addresses will be narrowed down.</p>\n<p>What is more, the paper also proposes measuring how quickly each bridge responds, which might tell the attacker something about how heavily the bridge operator is using their Tor client. If the attacker probes the rest of the Tor network, and sees a node with performance patterns similar to the bridge being probed, then it is likely that there is a connection going through that node and that bridge. In some circumstances this attack could be used to track connections all the way through the Tor network, and back to a client who is also acting as a bridge.</p>\n<p>One way of reducing the risk of these attacks succeeding is to run the bridge on a device which is always on. In this case, just because a bridge is running doesn't mean the operator is using Tor. Therefore less information is leaked to a potential attacker. As laptops become more prevalent, keeping a bridge on 24/7 can be inconvenient so the Tor Project is working on two bits of hardware (known as <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Torouters</a>) which can be left running a bridge even if the user's computer is off. If someone probes the bridge now, they can't learn much about whether the operator is using Tor as a client, and so it leaks less information about what the user is doing.</p>\n<p>Having an always-on bridge helps resist profiling based on when a client is on. However, evaluating the risk of profiling based on bridge performance is more complex. The reason this attack works is that when a node is congested, increasing traffic on one connection (say, due to the bridge operator using Tor) decreases the traffic on another (say, the attacker probing the bridge). If you run a Tor client on your PC, and a Tor bridge on a separate device, this reduces the opportunity for congestion on one leading to congestion on the other. However, there is still the possibility for congestion on the network connection which the bridge and device share, and maybe you do want to use the bridge device as a client too. So the Torouter helps, but doesn't fix the problem.</p>\n<p>To fully decouple bridges from clients, they need to run on different hardware <strong>and networks</strong>. Here the <a href=\"https://cloud.torproject.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tor Cloud</a> project is ideal &ndash; bridges run on Amazon's (or another cloud provider's) infrastructure so congestion on the bridge can't affect the Tor client running on your PC, or it's network.</p>\n<p>But maybe you do want to use your bridge as a client for whatever reason. Recall that the first step of the attack proposed by McLachlan and Hopper is to find the bridges' IP addresses. This is becoming increasingly difficult as more bridges are being set up. Also, there is work in progress to make it harder to scan networks for bridges. Originally this was intended to make it harder to find and block bridges, but it applies equally well to preventing probing. These schemes (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/bridgespa-wpes.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">BridgeSPA</a> by Smits et. al.) mean that just because you have a bridge's IP address, it doesn't mean that you can route traffic through it (to measure performance) or even check if the bridge is running. To do either, you need to have a secret which is distributed only to authorized users of the bridge.</p>\n<p>There is still more work to be done in protecting bridge operators, but the projects discussed above (and in the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/risks-serving-whenever-you-surf\" rel=\"nofollow\">previous blog post</a>) certainly improve the situation. Work continues both in academia and at the Tor Project to better understand the problem and develop further fixes.</p>"

ISPs and governments routinely restrict access to Internet content and services, either by censoring access to information or by degrading the performance of services or blocking them entirely. Similarly, ISPs can degrade network performance for certain sets of users for some or all services, for arbitrary purposes. ISPs have been found to block or throttle certain application traffic routinely. This growing trend toward blocking, tampering, or otherwise restricting communications on the Internet calls for improved techniques both for monitoring the state of restrictions on Internet content and communications, in order to inform users, and for circumventing attempts to censor, degrade, or otherwise tamper with Internet communications.</p>\n<p>The broadening scope of attacks on Internet freedom is forcing more disciplines to address the issue. Last year's workshop brought together four research communities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Those studying network neutrality and performance degradation</li>\n<li>Those measuring content censorship and blocking of resources and services</li>\n<li>Those designing and evaluating censorship circumvention tools</li>\n<li>Those who work on the wider implications of censorship, bringing perspectives from the worlds of policy, law, ethics, and political and social sciences</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This second workshop aims to repeat and promote this critical interdisciplinary approach.</p>\n<p>Six-page short-paper submissions are due April 26 (<b>edit: May 3</b>), and the workshop is August 6 near Seattle.

    "content": "<p>In the summer of 2011, I spent a few months learning how to effectively reverse engineer Windows software. I'm still learning and while I have a lifetime of learning to do on the topic, I chose to audit Ultrasurf as a challenge. This research was performed as a labor of love and it was funded work. My interest in reverse engineering Ultrasurf comes entirely because I have seen people promoting it without also offering evidence that it is safe. Additionally, a few people had asked me what I thought of the software and in order to form an opinion, I decided to dig deeper.</p>\n<p>Ultrasurf is software produced by the UltraReach company for censorship circumvention, privacy, security and anonymity. Unfortunately for them, I found their claims to be overstated and I found a number of serious problems with Ultrasurf.</p>\n<p>My report is available for download from the following link: <a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/misc/2012-04-16-ultrasurf-analysis.pdf\">https://media.torproject.org/misc/2012-04-16-ultrasurf-analysis.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Most of <a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/misc/2012-04-16-ultrasurf-analysis.pdf\">my research</a> was done while traveling in Brazil, Canada, Germany, and very small amount of it was performed in the US. Additionally, a number of interesting data points in my research paper came from interception devices in Syria. As of early April 2012, an independent tester confirmed many of my findings from China; the versions of Ultrasurf tested did directly connect to blocked addresses and did not in-fact work at all. Newer versions appear to have different, not yet blocked, addresses baked into the program.</p>\n<p>I believe that coordinated disclosure is reasonable in most cases and I ensured that Ultrasurf was notified long before the publication of this blog post. I had a face to face meeting in early December of 2011 to discuss my findings with the lead developer of Ultrasurf and to give them time to fix the problems that I discovered. Ultrasurf updated their website to change a number of their  security, privacy and anonymity claims; they did not actually remove all of the bogus claims, merely the most egregious statements. Our meeting was overall quite positive and in fact led me to write notes that may become a second paper.</p>\n<p>However, for various reasons, I've had to sit silently on this report for nearly four full months after our December meeting. I believe it is important to ensure that the issues discovered and discussed in my paper are resolved and that users are not kept in harm's way. I have serious concerns about ongoing security issues for the users of Ultrasurf and that is my primary reason for wishing to perform and release this research for all to see.</p>\n<p>Here's the abstract of the paper:<br />\n<i>Ultrasurf is a proxy-based program promoted for Internet censorship circumvention. This report gives a technical analysis of the Ultrasurf software and network. We present the results of reverse engineering the Ultrasurf client program, give an in-depth study of the known Ultrasurf network, especially those portions that interface in some way with the client or the Internet, and discuss network signatures that would allow an adversary to detect its use on a network. We cover client bootstrapping methods, censorship and censorship resistance, anonymity, user tagging by Ultrasurf and other parties, cryptographic internals and other previously unknown or undiscovered details about the Ultrasurf client and the Ultrasurf network. We find that it is possible to monitor and block the use of Ultrasurf using commercial off-the-shelf software. In particular, BlueCoat sells software and hardware solutions with such capabilities that have been deployed in Syria and other countries.</p>\n<p>The vulnerabilities presented in this paper are not merely theoretical in nature; they may present life-threatening danger in hostile situations. We recommend against the use of Ultrasurf for anonymity, security, privacy and Internet censorship circumvention.</i></p>\n<p>The main substance of the paper takes the time to refute nearly all of the claims that UltraReach makes on their website about their software Ultrasurf:<br />\n<i>This paper addresses the following claims  by UltraReach and other Ultrasurf advocates about the Ultrasurf client and Ultrasurf network:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> “Ultrasurf enables users to browse any website freely” — refuted in Section 3.1\n<li> “employs a decoying mechanism to thwart any tracing effort of its communication with its infrastructure.” — refuted in Section 5.13\n<li> “Protect your privacy online with anonymous surfing and browsing. Ultrasurf hides your IP address, clears<br />\nbrowsing history, cookies, and more.” — refuted in Section 6.2 and Section 6.3.</p>\n<li> “change IP addresses a million times an hour” — refuted in Section 6.1\n<li> “Untraceable” — refuted in Section 6.10\n<li> “Unblockable: Client uses wide array of discovery mechanisms to find an available proxy server and, when necessary, to switch/hop to avoid tracking/blocking” — refuted in Section 6.8\n<li> “Invisible: Leaves no traces on the user’s computer, and its traffic is indistinguishable from normal access to HTTPS sites” — refuted in Section 5.12\n<li> “Anonymous: No registration is requires [sic], and no personally identifying information collected” — refuted in Section 6.10\n<li> “Tamperproof: Using privately-signed SSL certificates which dont depend on external, potentially compromised CAs (thus preempting MITM attacks), Ultrasurf proactively detects attempts by censors to reverse-engineer, sabotage, or otherwise interfere in the secure operation of the tool” — refuted in Section 5.8.\n</ol>\n<p>We conclude that each of these claims is false, incorrect, or misleading.<br />\n</i></p>\n<p>The issues involved in the writing, discussion and publication of this report are the stuff of movies. It has taken ages to publish this report and attempts at coordinated disclosure have been time consuming, largely fruitless and extremely frustrating. While some of the issues I have identified have been fixed, to the best of my knowledge the most important issues, such as a lack of forward secrecy, remain serious outstanding security issues. Ultrasurf often boasts of their decade long fight against censorship and while I respect the spirit of their efforts, I have a hard time respecting the technical implementation. I'm afraid that they've not had forward secrecy in their cryptographic protocol for that entire decade. Ultrasurf also often boasts of being untraceable when in fact they admitted to logging and disclosing user identifying logs to law enforcement when the data was requested.  These kinds of security failures, both social and technical, are simply negligent and it means that users have been and are likely still in harm's way.</p>\n<p>I firmly believe that Ultrasurf must publish their full technical specifications, peer review their designs of both obfuscation and cryptography, open their source code for the world to review and they must absolutely discontinue <b>all</b> data retention without exception.</p>\n<p>I hope you'll enjoy the research presented in <a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/misc/2012-04-16-ultrasurf-analysis.pdf\">the paper</a> and that it will help everyone to move towards building a more secure set of options for users.</p>\n<p><b>Update:</b><br />\nUltraReach/Ultrasurf have released <a href=\"http://ultrasurf.us/Ultrasurf-response-to-Tor-definitive-review.pdf\">a response document</a> and <a href=\"http://ultrasurf.us/Ultrasurf-response-to-Tor-definitive-review.html\">a response page</a> that confirms a number of my claims, side steps a large swath of them and then attacks me, Tor and others for the report. They specifically claim that what is true in my paper is for older versions of Ultrasurf. They do not disclose which versions or when the fixes were released. This is a typical vendor tactic considering that they pressured me not to release the report until they felt they were given enough time to fix the issues involved. They also believe that I claim that Ultrasurf was broken but at no time did I ever claim it was broken; rather, I said it has problems. The claims they made and make do not live up to the implementation of policies or technical capabilities. This I think is quite reasonable because their claims were, frankly, entirely unreasonable.</p>\n<p>I put a great deal of time and effort into disclosing these report findings to Ultrasurf - both what would be considered responsible and coordinated - it's too bad that they've decided to ignore most of the findings and to attack me over the undefendable issues.</p>\n<p><b>Another Update:</b> Collin Anderson has written up <a href=\"http://b.averysmallbird.com/entries/the-need-for-community-participation-and-clear-disclosure-processes-in-the-case-of-ultrasurf\">his view of the disclosure process</a>. He is an independently involved third party that attempted to mediate our disclosure, solutions and a reasonable time frame for all parties involved.</p>"

    "content": "<h1 id=\"the-quick-trip-report\">The quick trip report</h1>\n<p>I spent the past week in Sweden for the Stockholm Internet Forum<sup><a href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref1\">1</a></sup>, to meet up with our funders at Sida<sup><a href=\"#fn2\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref2\">2</a></sup>, and to meet some activists looking for help and advice for their cause back in their home countries. Overall, it was a great trip. The Biståndsminister (Minister for Development)<sup><a href=\"#fn3\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref3\">3</a></sup>, Gunilla Carlsson, specifically named Tor in her speech as a project she is proud to support and fund.</p>\n<p>In the afternoon, I gave a Tor talk to support DFRI <sup><a href=\"#fn4\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref4\">4</a></sup>. The room was in a different building, way in back, with few signs to direct you to it. Hanna from dfri went out to grab people. In a short while, the room was packed, with people standing in the back and people sitting in the window seats. I would say roughly 35 people came and left during the session. I purposely did a quick 30 minute tor talk to leave time for questions. There were lots of questions, most about how to help and improve tor. The TeliaSonera<sup><a href=\"#fn5\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref5\">5</a></sup> people were interested in the intersection of Tor and the EU Data Retention Directive being implemented in Sweden on May 1. I'm not sure if TeliaSonera is for or against data retention. Frank La Rue<sup><a href=\"#fn6\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref6\">6</a></sup>, Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, was in the room for most of the talk too.</p>\n<h1 id=\"misconceptions-around-tor\">Misconceptions around Tor</h1>\n<p>Many Europeans thought we were a Swedish company already and were generally surprised to hear we are from the States. The Latin Americans and Middle East people are cautiously supportive of Tor. I kept running into misconceptions about Tor, the charity, the software, and if we're humans or not. Hopefully this post will clear up these misconceptions.</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\n<li>Tor was not started by the US Navy. The US Naval Research Labs (NRL) started a project in the 1990s called onion routing<sup><a href=\"#fn7\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref7\">7</a></sup>. Tor uses the basic onion routing principles and applies them to the Internet. The volunteer Tor group started in 2001. The formal charity, The Tor Project, started in 2006. We continue to work with Dr. Paul Syverson from NRL on improving onion routing and therefore Tor.</li>\n<li>The goal of Tor is to give you control over your identity and privacy on the Internet. An equal goal is to enable research into anonymous communications on the Internet. We try very hard to make you anonymous by default. With this anonymity, it is up to you where you go, what you do, and what information about yourself you divulge. The goal is that you are in control.</li>\n<li>In 2011, Tor received a total of $1.3 million in funding from a few sources: Internews, The Broadcasting Board of Governers, Sida, SRI International, and roughly 700 individual donors. Our forthcoming audit will show the funding and how we spent it. People seem to think Tor is a massive operation with hundreds of millions in funding. We publish our audit reports and financial statements every year after our audit is complete<sup><a href=\"#fn8\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref8\">8</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>Tor has a paid staff of 13 people. 10 of the 13 are developers and researchers. We have a part-time CFO, a marketing/policy person, and an Executive Director. We rely heavily on thousands of volunteers. We care a great deal about our community. Our core people<sup><a href=\"#fn9\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref9\">9</a></sup> are the most dedicated to improving Tor and have contributed greatly to the cause. We are currently looking to make this 14 people by hiring a dedicated developer<sup><a href=\"#fn10\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref10\">10</a></sup>.</li>\n<li>We are human. Each of us involved is generally public about who we are and what we do for Tor. As we're only 13 people, we cannot be everywhere at once. We spend very, very little on marketing and advertising. A few of us, namely Roger, Jacob, Andrew, and Karen, do the bulk of public speaking. You can see various videos of our talks, lectures, and speeches in our media archive<sup><a href=\"#fn11\" class=\"footnoteRef\" id=\"fnref11\">11</a></sup>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, the trip to Sweden was successful. And I hope these five points clarify who and what is Tor.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/\" title=\"http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/\">http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/</a> <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sida.se/\" title=\"http://www.sida.se/\">http://www.sida.se/</a> <a href=\"#fnref2\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn3\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/7437\" title=\"http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/7437\">http://www.regeringen.se/sb/d/7437</a> <a href=\"#fnref3\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn4\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dfri.se/\" title=\"https://www.dfri.se/\">https://www.dfri.se/</a> <a href=\"#fnref4\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn5\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.teliasonera.com\" title=\"http://www.teliasonera.com\">http://www.teliasonera.com</a> <a href=\"#fnref5\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn6\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx\" title=\"http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx\">http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomOpinion/Pages/OpinionIndex.aspx</a> <a href=\"#fnref6\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn7\">\n<p><a href=\"http://www.onion-router.net/\" title=\"http://www.onion-router.net/\">http://www.onion-router.net/</a> <a href=\"#fnref7\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn8\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/financials.html.en\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/financials.html.en\">https://www.torproject.org/about/financials.html.en</a> <a href=\"#fnref8\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn9\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en\">https://www.torproject.org/about/corepeople.html.en</a> <a href=\"#fnref9\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn10\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs.html.en\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs.html.en\">https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs.html.en</a> <a href=\"#fnref10\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn11\">\n<p><a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/video/\" title=\"https://media.torproject.org/video/\">https://media.torproject.org/video/</a> <a href=\"#fnref11\" class=\"footnoteBackLink\">↩</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>"

The content of the websites in question appears to be in support of Muhammad Dahlan, the former leader of Fatah.</p>\n<p>The Hadara network in Palestine is using a transparent HTTP proxy to inspect content and to censor the content of specific sites. A transparent HTTP proxy intercepts all of the customer's access attempts, technically the HTTP requests being done on the network by the customer's browser, and then the proxy makes requests in place of the client.  Sometimes this is a good thing, especially on congested networks or very expensive network connections. This is useful because the proxy can serve the cached version of the requested object if it already has the most up to date version of the requested page; therefore an ISP may minimize the amount of traffic that needs to leave it's network. Sometimes it's a bad thing, such as when the ISP censors access to an otherwise normally available resource.</p>\n<p>We've found that the Hadara transparent HTTP proxy is not being used simply to decrease webpage loading times or to reduce costs. It is also being used to censor access and to block content. The <a href=\"http://ooni.nu\">Open Observatory of Network Interference</a> (<a href=\"http://ooni.nu/\">OONI</a>), did a scan of over 1 million websites to understand which ones where being censored and which were freely accessible.</p>\n<p>The OONI scanning techniques involved connecting to a known good HTTP server and making HTTP GET requests. Each GET request contained specially crafted Host header field that contained a given possibly blocked website. These requests were intercepted by the transparent HTTP proxy and when the site was present inside of the blocklist, it would return an error page, rather than the expected content.</p>\n<p>In each case of a blocked page, the error page would be served immediately (without requiring a connection to the outside network) it was possible to parallelize a large amount of simultaneous connections and to set a very low timeout value. Because of this we were able to probe access for the Alexa top 1 million domains in less than 7 days.</p>\n<p>At the moment there has not been any official response from the ISP in question and the actors responsible for the censorship have not come out. We believe that the access to information is an intrinsic human right and measures that limit people ability to read should be fought.</p>\n<p>For more technical details check out <a href=\"http://ooni.nu/releases/2012/Hadara_Palestine.html\">the full report on the OONI webpage</a>.</p>\n<p>For the journalistic stories relating to this filtering, please see <a href=\"http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=478726\">the article on Ma'An</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/palestinian-authority-found-block-critical-news-sites\">this post on EFF</a>.</p>"

Tails Greeter also adds some new options:\n<ul>\n<li>Activating persistence (see below).</li>\n<li>Setting a sudo password. Unlike earlier Tails releases, full sudo access via an empty password is not available any more. In fact, full sudo access is disabled per default, but can be enabled by setting this password. See <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/index.en.html#tails_greeter\" rel=\"nofollow\">the documentation</a> for details.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Tails USB installer.</strong> This graphical user interface mostly obsoletes our old instructions of cat'ing the .iso directly onto a block device. All of the USB drive must be dedicated to Tails; a bit of extra space is reserved so that future Tails releases will fit when upgrading, and the rest can be used for persistence (see below) or manually formatted if the user so wishes. See <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/usb_installation/index.en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the USB installation documentation</a> for details.</li>\n<li><strong>Persistence</strong> can optionally be used when running Tails from a USB drive. Application configurations and arbitrary directories can be made persistent. See <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/index.en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">the persistence documentation</a> for details.</li>\n<li><strong>iceweasel</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Install iceweasel 10.0.4esr-1 (Extended Support Release).</li>\n<li>Search plugins: replace Debian-provided DuckDuckGo search plugin with the \"HTML SSL\" one; add ixquick.com; remove Scroogle.</li>\n<li>Enable TLS false start.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Vidalia</strong>: upgrade to 0.2.17-1+tails1</li>\n<li><strong>Internationalization</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Install all available iceweasel l10n packages.</li>\n<li>Add fonts for Hebrew, Thai, Khmer, Lao and Korean languages.</li>\n<li>Add bidi support.</li>\n<li>Don't purge locales anymore.</li>\n<li>Don't remove any Scribus translations anymore.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Hardware support</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Linux 3.2.15-1 (linux-image-3.2.0-2-amd64).</li>\n<li>Fix low sound level on MacBook5,2.</li>\n<li>Disable laptop-mode-tools automatic modules. This modules set often needs some amount of hardware-specific tweaking to work properly. This makes them rather not well suited for a Live system.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Software</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Install GNOME keyring.</li>\n<li>Install the Traverso multitrack audio recorder and editor.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Miscellaneous</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>NetworkManager is now started at PostLogin time by tails-greeter, rather than as a system service.</li>\n<li>Pidgin: don't use the OFTC hidden service anymore. It proved to be quite unreliable, being sometimes down for days.</li>\n<li>Do not display storage volumes on Desktop. This workarounds a usability issue when persistence is enabled, and paves the way towards GNOME3's empty Desktop.</li>\n<li>Don't build hybrid ISO images anymore. They boot less reliably on a variety of hardware, and are made less useful by us shipping a USB installer from now on.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Plus the usual bunch of minor bug reports and improvements.</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"http://git.immerda.ch/?p=amnesia.git;a=blob_plain;f=debian/changelog;hb=refs/tags/0.11\" rel=\"nofollow\">online Changelog</a> for technical details.</p>\n<p>Don't hesitate to <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/support/index.en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">get in touch with us</a>.</p>"

Well, errors occur and version numbers don't cost any money, so basically 0.2.18 was released, a couple of issues were found and then we made 0.2.19 fixing them.</p>\n<p>You can find the source tarballs in here: https://www.torproject.org/dist/vidalia/</p>\n<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> Vidalia releases have been in sync with Tor Browser Bundle releases. This won't necessarily happen anymore. It became hard to sync all the software that TBB contains, so Vidalia releases got delayed for more urgent Firefox issues and things like that. We therefor decided that Vidalia will be released when ready, and TBB will get it at some point.</p>\n<p>So, if you don't want to build Vidalia from source, you need to be patient.</p>\n<p>Here's what changed for 0.2.18 and 0.2.19:</p>\n<p>0.2.18  14-May-2012</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use consensus bandwidth for routers when microdescriptors is<br />\n    enabled. Fixes bug 3287.</p>\n<li>Notify users that a warning status event has appeared by flashing<br />\n    the Message Log button. Fixes bug 3957.</li>\n<li>Fix a method that didn't return the specified type if another<br />\n    control method was selected. Fixes bug 4065.</li>\n<li>Resume listing relays in the Network Map panel even when Tor only<br />\n    offers microdescriptors (new in Tor 0.2.3.x). Fixes ticket 4203.</li>\n<li>Handle unrecognized Tor bootstrap phases. (Tor tells us a summary<br />\n    description of each bootstrap phase as it occurs, so we can use<br />\n    that string if needed.) Fixes bug 5109.</li>\n<li>Displays Korean, Catalan and Greek in their native scripts. Fix<br />\n    bug 5110.</li>\n<li>Support adding comments in the same line as a config option inside<br />\n    the torrc dialog. Fixes bug 5475.</li>\n<li>Remove Polipo and Torbutton from Vidalia's build scripts. Resolves<br />\n    ticket 5769.</li>\n<li>Fix deadlock when the browser process failed to launch in OS X.</li>\n<li>Add ProfileDirectory, DefaultProfileDirectory, PluginsDirectory,<br />\n    DefaultPluginsDirectory for better Browser configuration. Also set<br />\n    the Vidalia binary location as the starting point for relative<br />\n    paths.</li>\n<li>Enable Burmese, Croatian, Basque and Serbian translation.</li>\n<li>Remove the \"Find bridges\" button in order to avoid compromising<br />\n    users that need to hide behind tor at all times. Fixes bug 5371.</li>\n<li>Add visual feedback from VClickLabel when in \"pressed\" state.<br />\n    Resolves ticket 5766.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>0.2.19  30-May-2012</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable \"Run Vidalia when my system starts\" if the<br />\n    BrowserExecutable config option is set. This will avoid issues with<br />\n    TBB users starting Vidalia the wrong way.</li>\n<li>Automigrate TorExecutable, Torrc and DataDirectory config options<br />\n    to the new relative path handling.</li>\n<li>Really get rid of the openssl dependency. The goal had been to<br />\n    achieve that for 0.2.18, but not everything was actually removed.</li>\n<li>For static builds on windows, correctly link with zlib and<br />\n    ws32_2.lib.</li>\n</ul>"

We intend to work as hard as we can to improve this situation. </p>\n<p>However, we also know that even the keystone of true security is not yet properly in place. We know that we must properly deploy this keystone, or we risk the collapse of everything we have built so far.</p>\n<p>That keystone is the community that reviews our designs. It is the community that audits our source code. It is the community that tests the binaries produced from that source code. It is the community that will verify that the binaries that we distribute are produced from that source code and nothing else.</p>\n<p>It is time to organize our community into place to serve as that keystone. We cannot have true security without it.</p>\n<p><br><br />\nOur plan is to start small, with manual testing and manual analysis of each build. We will use that to incrementally work towards full automation available to be run on any of the arbitrary platform configurations available to the community. Runa Sandvik will begin coordinating these releases.</p>\n<p>We expect the process to be bumpy at first. To start, Runa will simply give interested people a url to a release candidate with a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5292\">grab bag of urls</a> along with some basic tests to perform within some time limit before the build is to be released. These urls will initially come from arbitrary pages around the web, but hopefully we'll eventually distill them into our own collection of minimal test cases for which testing is fully automated. Until that point, test pages will need to come with a description of expected behavior and results.  We're hoping that the community will also seek out new and useful test urls and write up result descriptions for them.</p>\n<p>We will soon be switching to the 10.x-ESR Firefox branch for our stable TBBs, while concurrently maintaining an alpha series based on Rapid Release. To minimize the incidence of surprise issues in the stable TBB when ESR undergoes major upgrades, we will need people devoted to testing both branches on multiple platforms. We will also need people running <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5791\">auditing systems that verify the TBB they test is well behaved</a>.</p>\n<p>To participate, please inform Runa via email (runa at torproject.org) which TBB branch or branches you intend to test on which platform (Operating System and CPU). Bonus points if you have a unique configuration such as AntiVirus software, and/or are able to analyze TBB in an auditing sandbox framework such as Seatbelt, AppArmor, SELinux, a firewall that will log proxy bypass attempts, or simply with Wireshark or any other network analyzer. Extra bonus points if you <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5767\">document your setup for others to use</a>.</p>\n<p><br><br />\nIndependent from the group Runa will coordinate, we also need people <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5837\">analyzing our builds</a>, to ensure against tampering at the build machines themselves. We need to use the differences uncovered by this analysis to work towards the ability to <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3688\">produce identical binaries on multiple, clean instances of build platforms</a> which can be brought up from scratch anywhere around the world.</p>\n<p>To help us get started, we will also need people who simply create independent builds for others to compare against our official builds. I suspect that many reversers and hobbyists interested in learning reversing may find devoting the system resources and time to build their own TBB binaries a prohibitive barrier.</p>\n<p>Basically, everyone should try to help eliminate the need for duplicate work done by others at each step of both the QA and build inspection processes. Similarly, we should be constantly looking to refine our testing and analysis processes to eliminate manual labor.</p>\n<p><br><br />\nThank you all for you willingness to help. Let's work together to build the world we want to live in.</p>"

The user did not report any errors when browsing to sites such as <a href=\"https://gmail.com\">Gmail</a>, <a href=\"https://facebook.com\">Facebook</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/\">Twitter</a>, which suggests that this was a targeted attack. The certificate was issued by a company called <a href=\"http://www.cyberoam.com/\">Cyberoam</a>. We first believed that this incident was similar to that of <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/detecting-certificate-authority-compromises-and-web-browser-collusion\">Comodo</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it\">DigiNotar</a>, and that Cyberoam had been tricked to issue a fake certificate for our website.</p>\n<p><center><br />\n<img src=\"https://media.torproject.org/image/blog-images/2012-07-03-screenshot-cyberoam-cropped.png\"><br />\n</center></p>\n<p>After a bit of research, we learned that Cyberoam <a href=\"http://www.cyberoamworks.com/\">make a range of devices</a> used for Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). The user was not just seeing a fake certificate for torproject.org, his connection was actually being intercepted by one of their devices. While investigating this further, Ben Laurie and I found a security vulnerability affecting all Cyberoam DPI devices.</p>\n<p>Examination of a certificate chain generated by a Cyberoam DPI device shows that all such devices share the same CA certificate and hence the  same private key. It is therefore possible to intercept traffic from any  victim of a Cyberoam device with any other Cyberoam device - or to extract the key from the device and import it into other DPI devices, and use those for interception.</p>\n<p>Ben and I wrote a <a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/misc/2012-07-03-cyberoam-CVE-2012-3372.txt\">security advisory</a> and notified Cyberoam of this vulnerability at 17:00 UTC on Saturday, June 30. We made it clear that we intended to publish this blog post and the security advisory on Tuesday, July 3, and encouraged them to respond promptly if they had  any comments. At the same time, we notified browser vendors and asked that they blacklist the Cyberoam CA certificate in their browsers.</p>\n<p>Cyberoam have not yet commented on this issue, apart from acknowledging our first email and saying that they are looking into it. The Cyberoam CA certificate is not trusted, and so browsers will show users a warning (unless someone has already installed the certificate). Users with the Tor Browser Bundle are not affected.</p>\n<p>To check if this CA is installed in your browser, see the following instructions for <a href=\"http://blog.devantis.com/?p=79\">Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome</a>, and <a href=\"http://fairerplatform.com/2011/09/how-to-disable-diginotar-ssl-certificate/\">Safari</a>. The instructions mention DigiNotar, but they are still valid. If you have more information about this issue, please email <a href=\"mailto:help@rt.torproject.org\">help@rt.torproject.org</a>.</p>"

The result though is a direct tradeoff with relay diversity: on today's network, clients choose one of the fastest 5 exit relays around 25-30% of the time, and 80% of their choices come from a pool of 40-50 relays.<br />\n<a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6443\" title=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6443\">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6443</a></p>\n<p>Since extra capacity is clearly good for performance, and since we're not doing particularly well at diversity with the current approach, we're going to try an experiment: we'll connect funding to exit relay operators so they can run bigger and/or better exit relays.</p>\n<p>If we do it right (make more faster exit relays that aren't the current biggest ones, so there are more to choose from), we will improve the network's diversity as well as being able to handle more users.</p>\n<p>We've lined up our first funder (BBG, aka <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/\" title=\"http://www.voanews.com/\">http://www.voanews.com/</a>), and they're excited to have us start as soon as we can. They want to sponsor 125+ fast exits.</p>\n<p>I've started a discussion on the tor-relays list about open questions that we as a community will need to decide about:<br />\n1) What exactly would we pay for?<br />\n2) Should we fund existing relays or new ones?<br />\n4) What exactly do we mean by diversity?<br />\n5) How much \"should\" an exit relay cost?<br />\n6) How exactly should we choose which exit relay operators to reimburse?<br />\n7) How do we audit / track the sponsored relays?<br />\n8) Legal questions?</p>\n<p>The first step is collecting facts about the current fast Tor exit relays.

    "content": "<p>Recently, we've been introduced to two &quot;Tor Project&quot; Facebook Org pages. Neither of which are run by us at Tor, yet. There was also a Google+ page for a while, too. We currently use a few social media methods, such as <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org\">mailing lists</a>, pgp web of trust, <a href=\"ircs://irc.torproject.org/#tor\">internet relay chat</a>, <a href=\"https://identi.ca/torproject\">Identi.ca</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/torproject\">Twitter</a>. Some people are very upset Tor is seemingly supporting Facebook, Google+ and others.</p>\n<p>We're expanding into Facebook, Google+, Reddit, and others because our users are asking for it. There are existing Tor communities in many places, and we don't need to formally be at them all. It's great when individuals step up to the challenge and represent Tor in positive ways. However, as people join these communities, they are looking for a real discussion with us. For many people, these platforms are the primary means of communication.</p>\n<p>We do have some concerns about social media sites. Let's enumerate these concerns.</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\n<li>\n<p>Current social media solutions don't respect user privacy, however it's all we have today. With buttons like \"+1\", \"Like\", and \"Tweet this\" strewn about websites, tracking your normal web activity, Tor is at least one solution to help you stop this global tracking. We believe you should be fully in control of your own data and metadata.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The users are currently using these systems in very unsafe ways. We can join the system and set up a presence with details about how to use these systems more safely--or if they cannot be used safely at all. The goal is to educate people.The EFF has an <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/free-speech-weak-link#platforms\">explanation</a> of these risks as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We can get our message out to people and have a discussion with them, where they are, even though we don't control the medium and risk getting kicked off the system.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some are impersonating us now, and not at the quality level we want to see. A bad answer or impression from a fake Tor is worse than no answer at all.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why don't we write our own?</p>\n<p>Writing and deploying our own social media system is beyond the scope of our mission. However, tor can provide an anonymous base for such a system. We have hope for systems like <a href=\"https://joindiaspora.com/\">Diaspora</a>, <a href=\"http://tent.io\">tent</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.freedomboxfoundation.org/\">FreedomBox</a>.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Ohio University EW Scripps Journalism School Trip Report for 07 to 09 November 2012</p>\n<p>Danny O'Brien of <a href=\"https://cpj.org/\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> and I were invited to talk to journalism students at the <a href=\"http://scrippsjschool.org/\">E.W. Scripps School of Journalism</a> in <a href=\"http://www.ohio.edu/\">Ohio University</a>. The topics were around computer security risks and protections from the perspective of journalists. CPJ maintains a great guide for reporters to survive dangerous situations appropriately called the <a href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/journalist-security-guide.php\">Journalist Security Guide</a>. This covers both offline and online situations. My role was to highlight the experience of Tor, what we've seen, and how we've protected both citizen and professional journalists the world over. I also covered using <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org\">Tails</a> as one tool in your toolbox to let you do the work of a journalist from anywhere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://scrippsjschool.org/faculty/faculty_details.php?oak=%20alexanda\">Andy Alexander</a> was our host for the three days. We started off with a great dinner to share information about what both Danny and I have learned over the past few years in working with journalists. Andy has a long career of experience in foreign correspondence and reporting. His experiences covering a few decades highlight the need for journalists to learn how to protect themselves when reporting anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p>The next day was a first-year class about journalism in general. Danny and I presented to around 200 students. The computer couldn't read my USB drive, so I couldn't use <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2012-11-08-Scripps-IIJ-Presentation.pdf\">my presentation</a>, rather I used the website to quickly cover Tor, how it works, and why journalists should care. I then discussed a range of attacks against an individual from fairly basic malware infections through more advanced traffic analysis and content swapping. My <a href=\"http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox\">PirateBox</a> did work, so anyone could get the presentations and copies of Tor locally if they so desired.</p>\n<p>We had a great lunch with <a href=\"http://scrippsjschool.org/faculty/faculty_details.php?oak=%20kalyango\">Professor Kalyango</a> and then head off to <a href=\"http://woub.org/news\">WOUB</a> for a 30 minute podcast/radio interview.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, we went off to the main panel event to talk to fourth year and graduate students about online security and the risks for journalists. Once again, the USB drive couldn't be read, but the <a href=\"http://wiki.daviddarts.com/PirateBox\">PirateBox</a> worked fine. The lecture lasted around 90 minutes with a Q&amp;A session. Unlike the freshman class, a number of people had questions or wanted to verify what Danny and I stated.</p>\n<p>We were then taken out to dinner by the top students at the J School. It was a great Middle Eastern kabob place to have an hour of discussions with the students.</p>\n<p>And thanks to <a href=\"http://www.athensinteractivist.com/\">Lindsay</a> for getting up at 06:30 to drive me to the airport and for the great discussion along the way. I look forward to reading her dispatches from East Africa in the near future.</p>\n<p>Also published via email at <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2012-November/000082.html\" title=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2012-November/000082.html\">https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2012-November/000082....</a></p>"

Most of the people in the audience were already DV advocates and aware of the way technology is used to harm or manipulate others. The user stories have come from a number of places, between phone calls, email support, and actually being out in the world talking to survivors or advocates who want to help.</p>\n<p>I co-presented with Sarah from <a href=\"https://www.abine.com\">Abine</a> and Valenda from <a href=\"http://gbls.org/\">Greater Boston Legal Services</a>. All three of our presentations can be found on Tor's <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~andrew/2012-11-16-EADV/\">people server</a>.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, a number of people came up to me to ask about getting Tails or Tor Browser, or to simply introduce themselves. I met a cyber-stalking survivor I've only helped via email and phone over the past year or so. I look forward to doing more of these types of events locally.</p>"

    "content": "<p>The UK government has proposed a new bill which would allow UK law enforcement agencies to require that \"telecommunication operators\" (e.g. ISPs and website operators) intercept and record their users' traffic data (i.e. details of who is communicating with whom, when, from where, and how much, but not the content of communications). The <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm83/8359/8359.pdf\">draft of this bill</a>, the Communications Data Bill (dubbed the \"Snoopers' Charter\" by some), has been published and has met widespread criticism for the unprecedented intrusion of privacy it would permit.</p>\n<p>The impact on Tor is less than some have feared, because it is likely that The Tor Project is not a telecommunication operator for the purposes of the bill (because the nodes which carry data are not run by The Tor Project) and Tor's distributed architecture reduces the harm which may be caused by the compromise of traffic data. However, the proposed bill is still bad for privacy, especially for users of systems which don't offer the same protections as Tor, so I submitted written evidence to the parliamentary committee investigating the bill, on behalf of the Tor Project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/parliament12commsdata.pdf\">Our submission</a> gave an introduction to Tor, how it works, and how it is used, and in particular how important Tor was for maintaining the safety of human rights activists working in repressive regimes. The submission also discusses the risks of the proposed bill, especially the harm which would come if traffic data collected were compromised (as happened <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/01/operation-aurora/\">to Google</a>) or interception equipment installed for complying with the bill were enabled without authorization (as happend <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-athens-affair/\">to Vodafone in Greece</a>).</p>\n<p>Our submission has been published with the <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/joint-committees/communications-data/written%20evidence%20Volume.pdf\">others</a>, and I was also invited to give evidence to the committee in person. The <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/joint-committees/communications-data/uc060912ev8HC479viii%20(consol%20panel%202).pdf\">transcript of this session</a> has been published with some minor redactions requested by other companies presenting evidence, but none of my answers have been redacted. Further information about the activities of this committee, including transcripts of other sessions, can be found on <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/joint-select/draft-communications-bill/\">committee's page</a>.</p>\n<p>Based on the discussions which have taken place, it appears that the committee has serious reservations about the bill but we will not know for sure until the committee publishes their report, expected within a few weeks. Efforts to campaign against the bill continue, particularly by the <a href=\"http://www.openrightsgroup.org/issues/ccdp\">Open Rights Group</a>.</p>"

My first goal is to remind them of all the good uses of Tor, so if they ever find themselves lobbying to outlaw anonymity online, they'll understand what they're giving up. The second goal is to make sure they understand what Tor is and how it works, so if they encounter it in their investigations they'll hassle our exit relay operators less. (Here's a great way that one FBI person explained it to me: \"I've got 10 leads, and 48 hours before this case doesn't matter anymore. If you can help me understand which leads *not* to follow, I can do my job better.\") My third goal is to help them be able to use Tor correctly for their own jobs &mdash; remember that diversity of users is part of what makes Tor safe for everybody to use.</p>\n<p>Overall, we've been doing a pretty good job at teaching US-based law enforcement about Tor. At the end of the conference, one of the FBI agents took me aside and asked \"surely you have *some* sort of way of tracking your users?\" When I pointed at various of his FBI colleagues in the room who had told me they use Tor every day for their work, and asked if he'd be comfortable if we had a way of tracing *them*, I think he got it.</p>\n<p>I met a nice man from the DEA who worked on the \"Farmer's Market\" bust. This was in the news a lot back in April, where apparently some people were selling drugs online, and using a Tor hidden service for their website. At the time I thought the news stories could be summarized simply as \"idiot drug sellers accept paypal payments, get busted.\" It turns out they were pretty smart about how to accept paypal payments &mdash; they just had random Americans receive the paypal payments, take a cut, and then turn them into a Panama-based digital currency, and the Panama company didn't want to help trace where the money went. The better summary for the news stories should actually have been \"idiot drug sellers use hushmail, get busted.\" Way before they switched to a Tor hidden service, the two main people used Hushmail to communicate. After a subpoena (and apparently a lot of patience since Canada still isn't quite the same as the US), Hushmail rolled over and gave up copies of all the emails. Many more details here:<br />\nhttp://www.scribd.com/doc/89690597/Willemsindictment-Filed-045</p>\n<p>I should still note that Tor doesn't introduce any magic new silver bullet that causes criminals to be uncatchable when before they weren't. The Farmer's Market people ran their webserver in some other foreign country before they switched to a Tor hidden service, and just the fact that the country didn't want to cooperate in busting them was enough to make that a dead end. Jurisdictional arbitrage is alive and well in the world.</p>"

There are a bunch of new Tor-related research papers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes12-cogs\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Changing of the Guards: A Framework for Understanding and Improving Entry Guard Selection in Tor\"</a>.  Basically Tariq has written a suite of tools for analyzing how likely an adversary is to be able to see a Tor user's circuits given various values for guard selection and guard rotation. Early results include \"three guards is probably the wrong number\" and \"we probably shouldn't rotate guards so often\". Later results I hope will include \"here's an algorithm for assigning the Guard flag to relays that makes users safer\".</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes12-torchestra\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Torchestra: Reducing interactive traffic delays over Tor\"</a>. This paper suggests having two parallel TLS connections between each pair of relays &mdash; one for the loud circuits and one for the quiet ones. I've had a series of debates with Rob Jansen over whether this should really help, or if it's just shifting the round-robining to a deeper level (e.g. kernel-level buffers). My current opinion is that it should really help, not because it writes important bytes out faster, but because the other side can *read* important bytes faster &mdash; in the current state a relay can't predict which incoming bytes are going to be high-priority, but when high-priority bytes come on a separate TCP connection, it's easy to tell.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs2012-classification\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Enhancing Tor's Performance using Real-time Traffic Classification\"</a>. I haven't read it in detail yet, but it looks at using machine learning to classify circuits depending on what sort of traffic they're carrying. This direction is worthwhile, but it skips over the question that Rob and I are currently wrestling with, which is \"ok, so you've decided to give lower priority to a circuit. What should you actually do to make that circuit put less load on the network?\" See also Rob's Usenix Security paper: <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#throttling-sec12\" title=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#throttling-sec12\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#throttling-sec12</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs2012-skypemorph\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"SkypeMorph: Protocol Obfuscation for Tor Bridges\"</a>. The idea is to use the actual Skype program to make a (TCP) video call between user and bridge, and then drop the call and start up your own UDP traffic flows that mimic Skype's UDP flows in terms of size and timing. I'm not clear that trying to look like Skype is a game we can win (especially with DPI-level adversaries already playing the arms race to detect and block 'real' Skype, and with the wasted bandwidth that comes with pretending to be a Skype video call), but I think we can get a lot of mileage out of a Tor pluggable transport that carries Tor traffic over a UDP flow &mdash; especially with recent rumors of a Syrian ISP throttling all TCP flows.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs2012-stegotorus\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"StegoTorus: A Camouflage Proxy for the Tor Anonymity System\"</a>. Stegotorus is an <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy\" rel=\"nofollow\">obfsproxy</a> fork with two goals: first, chop up Tor traffic flows so you can't recognize Tor traffic just by looking for more 586-byte TCP packets than usual; and second, transport those chopped-up flows over a variety of steg modules, to hide the traffic in protocols that the adversary is unwilling to block (as opposed to obfsproxy's goal, which is to make a flow that's hard enough to DPI for that the adversary has to choose between blocking all unrecognized protocols or letting the flows through). Unfortunately, there aren't any great steg modules yet; rather, it aims to be a framework where if you *did* have a great steg module, you could just pop it in.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs2012-censorspoofer\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"CensorSpoofer: Asymmetric Communication using IP Spoofing for Censorship-Resistant Web Browsing\"</a>. It's designed for censored users who mostly consume bytes rather than produce them. This design also uses a UDP stream to deliver the bytes, but they spoof the stream as coming from a plausible-looking voip client rather than from the real source. Then they need some low-latency low-bandwidth way (e.g. instant messaging) to get the upstream packets to the server.</li>\n<li>There's also <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs2012-fingerprinting\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Touching from a Distance: Website Fingerprinting Attacks and Defenses\"</a>. But I confess I haven't looked at it yet. Website fingerprinting remains a huge and open issue that needs more attention.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This recent variety of pluggable-transport designs and research papers is fantastic. It also makes me realize that somebody should put some effort into identifying the various components that a Tor transport system needs, and which papers provide which components. For example, it sounds like SkypeMorph and CensorSpoofer could share the same details for the link encryption and flow control for their UDP stream, rather than inventing two separately. Similarly, the \"small upstream channel\" requirement from CensorSpoofer reminds me of the similar goal that David's <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#flashproxy-pets12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flashproxy</a> design faces. I see that Tariq and Ian have <a href=\"http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2012/cacr2012-33.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">a new tech report</a> out that gives that a start.</p>"

Just a friendly heads up concerning a couple things going on in our python controller space.</p>\n<p>The first is that Mike and I have decided to deprecate <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pytorctl.git\">TorCtl</a> and make it a part of TorFlow (the framework used to support the Bandwidth Authorities and SoaT). The TorCtl codebase has largely been frozen for years out of concern for the stability of the Bandwidth Authorities (which lack any tests).</p>\n<p>If you're writing scripts or controller applications for Tor then you're encouraged to move to either...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h2><a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/\">Stem</a></h2>\n<p>\nLibrary with a similar design to TorCtl, but friendlier APIs and documentation. This has reached feature parity with TorCtl and is still being actively developed, so if there's something it can do to better suit your needs then please let me know!\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h2><a href=\"https://txtorcon.readthedocs.org/\">Txtorcon</a></h2>\n<p>\nTwisted controller library written by Meejah, and used in projects like Ooni Probe.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both of these libraries have extensive test suites and are being very actively maintained.</p>\n<p>\n<hr /></p>\n<p>The second part are my plans regarding Stem. As of early December we've reached feature completion, covering just about everything in the control-spec and dir-spec.</p>\n<p>Next up is migrating our controllers. So far we've moved <a href=\"http://www.atagar.com/arm/\">arm</a> (the largest python controller we have) and the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/atagar/tor-utils.git/blob/HEAD:/consensusTracker.py\">consensus-tracker</a>. Other controllers we have queued up to move are TorBEL, Tor Weather, and the control interpretor.</p>\n<p>I've avoided making an initial release announcement for stem because until we have actual users of the library we won't be sure that we nailed a nice, intuitive API (and hence, can't promise that it'll be frozen).</p>\n<p>On reflection this is letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. Stem's API is unlikely to change substantially, and holding off on an initial release poses a chicken-and-egg situation. Users want a frozen API before using stem, but we need users before feeling confident enough to lock down the API.</p>\n<p>So here's what I propose. For the next couple months stem will have an open beta. If you'd like to have input on the future of our python controller space then please give Stem a try and <a href=\"http://www.atagar.com/contact/\">tell me the following</a>...</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>What pain points did you encounter? Is there anything that you'd like to see changed or that we're missing?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If your project is public then please tell me where I can find your code. I'll review it, both to suggest improvements and see how we can tweak stem to better suit your needs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the unlikely event we make a backward incompatible change I'll check with the beta participants to be sure we don't break anyone (and submit fixes if we do).</p>\n<p>Cheers! -Damian (atagar on irc)</p>\n<p>PS. Many thanks to Ravi, Sean, Eoin, Beck, Erik, Megan, Sathyanarayanan, and everyone else who has helped stem get to this point. Happy New Year!</p>"

He convinced me that controlling \"the worst of the worst\" in terms of how they can present their product will influence how these products spread.</li>\n<li>That said, these were all (foreign) policy experts, not technologists. They all seemed to take it for granted that you could draw a line between \"bad\" products and acceptable / dual-use products. I tried to hold back from saying \"every time you people try to come up with legal phrasings about what technologies are ok, you end up putting tools like mine on the wrong side of the line.\" In retrospect, I should have said it more loudly.</li>\n<li>They were really proud to have Tor representatives there.

And now you're surprised and upset when bad people use these same backdoors?

    "content": "<p>In December I attended the award ceremony for the <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2012/12/11/first-annual-access-innovation-awards-prize-winners-announced\">2012 Access Innovation Awards</a>. Their finalists included three projects that Tor maintains or co-maintains: <a href=\"https://ooni.torproject.org/\">OONI</a> (a framework for writing open network censorship measurement tests, and for making the results available in an open way; see its <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/ooni-probe.git\">git repo</a>), <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/\">Flash Proxy</a> (a creative way to let people run <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges\">Tor bridges</a> in their browser just by visiting a website; see its <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/flashproxy.git\">git repo</a>), and <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\">HTTPS Everywhere</a> (a Firefox extension to force https connections for websites that support https but don't use it by default; see its <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/https-everywhere.git\">git repo</a>). Of these, OONI and Flash Proxy ended up being winners in their respective categories.</p>\n<p>(The Access Innovation Prize gave $100,000 across 5 categories to individuals, organizations and networks who submitted \"the best actionable ideas on how to use information technology to promote and enable human rights and deliver social good.\")</p>\n<p>I'm happy that people are recognizing some of the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer#Projects\">cool projects</a> that Tor works on. But more than that, it's interesting to watch how our projects are integrating into the broader community. The HTTPS Everywhere website is hosted by EFF, and the tool is co-developed by EFF and The Tor Project. The Flash Proxy submission was actually submitted by the New America Foundation's <a href=\"http://oti.newamerica.net/\">OTI</a> group, where they plan to work on integrating the Flash Proxy badge into a Facebook app (don't worry, they're splitting the prize money with David Fifield, the main Flash Proxy developer). We (Tor) wouldn't be able to have this reach if we didn't have these other organizations working on our topics too.</p>\n<p>More generally, the line around what counts as a Tor project has been getting blurrier over the years. We're a community based around <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software\">free</a> software and transparent design and development, and when we encounter somebody else who is \"doing it right\", we embrace them and offer whatever resources we can to help them succeed. One nice example is Nathan Freitas of <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/\">Guardian</a> &mdash; he started maintaining an Android version of Tor, and we liked how he was doing it, so we called him a Tor developer. When Nathan uses his Tor affiliation to get funders to listen to him about mobile security issues, everybody wins. Similarly, while David Fifield spends most of his time being a Stanford grad student, he's made such progress on Flash Proxy that we're paying a <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-pluggabletransport\">second Flash Proxy developer</a> to help him with <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2012-December/004254.html\">Windows deployment</a>. It's great that OTI is working in this <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports\">pluggable transport</a> space too. There's no shortage of hard problems and development tasks to go around.</p>\n<p>I'm glad I attended the awards evening. I confess that I was worried it would be full of media hype, with journalists lined up to write hasty and shallow articles. (I suppose I'm jaded by being followed around at hacker conferences by journalists with quotas and deadlines. But I was particularly worried this time because both OONI and Flash Proxy are young projects, and we'd be wisest to make some real progress before drawing mainstream media attention to them.) Instead, the attendees were a variety of enthusiastic, not-very-technical New York City residents. Most of them hadn't heard of Tor and had only a very general understanding of Internet privacy and censorship issues; so I had my work cut out for me in terms of advocacy and awareness-building. Highlights included conversations with people from <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/\">Committee to Protect Journalists</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/\">Human Rights Watch</a>, and several similar organizations &mdash; these are exactly the sort of orgs that needs the neutral censorship measurement results that OONI aims to provide.</p>"

This time we focused on explaining all the various Tor project components (mostly development-related) that <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer#Projects\">need help</a> from the broader community.</p>\n<p>The talk went well, but we were in the smaller room, and we and the conference organizers had failed to communicate that it was meant to be more of a workshopy atmosphere. We had a lot of people there who just wanted to see the sequel to our <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwMr8Xl7JMQ\">spectacle</a> last year, and it meant we turned away many hundred Tor enthusiasts. Live and learn I guess. I did end up holding a post-talk Tor Q&amp;A session that lasted for seven hours.</p>\n<p>I'm still patiently waiting for the official video to emerge [Edit: <a href=\"http://ftp.ccc.de/congress/2012/mp4-h264-HQ/29c3-5306-en-the_tor_software_ecosystem_h264.mp4\">here it is!</a>], but in the meantime there's a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rnbc_9JnVtc\">youtube copy of the video stream</a>; you can look at <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/~arma/slides-29c3.odp\">the</a> <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/~arma/slides-29c3.pdf\">slides</a> too.</p>\n<p>Some other highlights from Congress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be sure to watch the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDM3MqHln8U\">DoJ/NSA whistleblower talk</a> (<a href=\"http://events.ccc.de/congress/2012/Fahrplan/events/5338.en.html\">blurb</a>).</li>\n<li>We talked to Christian Grothoff about <a href=\"https://gnunet.org/pwnat\">NAT piercing</a> for Flash Proxy. One of the main deficiencies in the current <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/\">Flash Proxy</a> design is that the censored user needs to be reachable on the Internet (i.e. not behind a firewall or NAT). While we can't expect the flash proxy bridge running in a browser to be able to craft arbitrary packets (required for most NAT piercing tricks), Peter Palfrader pointed out that we *can* expect the Flash Proxy facilitator to be able to send such packets on behalf of each volunteer bridge. Cute trick &mdash; wonder if it'll work.</li>\n<li>I introduced Harry Halpin (W3C) to David Fifield (Flash Proxy). Web browsers are trying to catch up to Skype in terms of real-time media interactions. That means UDP flows, NAT piercing, link encryption, and more, all in the browser. Flash Proxy could sure make use of all that. And the folks working on the <a href=\"http://www.webrtc.org/\">WebRTC</a> specifications could use some broader use cases.</li>\n<li>I met several great people from <a href=\"http://www.bof.nl/\">Bits of Freedom</a>, the Dutch NGO that is a sort of hybrid EFF/ACLU for the Netherlands. It seems like only a few years ago that we were lamenting that Europe has too few advocacy organizations to challenge bad laws and policies &mdash; <a href=\"http://www.edri.org/issues/privacy/dataretention\">data retention</a>, <a href=\"http://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/How_to_act_against_ACTA\">ACTA</a>, etc. That's changing!</li>\n<li>I talked to Linus Nordberg, who runs several fast exits in Sweden as part of <a href=\"https://dfri.se/\">DFRI</a> and has been pondering running a bunch of bridges too. The question is: what are the tradeoffs between running both the bridges and exits on the same network (more centralization) vs partitioning them so they run on distinct netblocks?  Counterintuitively, due to the \"no more than one node on a given /16\" rule in Tor's <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git?a=blob_plain;hb=HEAD;f=path-spec.txt\">path selection strategy</a>, centralizing the bridges and exits on the same netblock actually improves safety against some adversaries. My recommendation to him was that having more bridges and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2012-July/001433.html\">exits</a> is still better than not, even though the diversity issues remain open and complex research questions.</li>\n<li>I also talked to Linus about what we should do with relays whose exit policies only allow ports commonly used for plaintext traffic. Is that a hint that they're set up by jerks to sniff traffic? Or did the operator not even think about that issue? Should we set the BadExit flag for them?  It seems that's a tough arms race for us to win, since they could just choose to exit to a few more ports and suddenly they blend back in. Ultimately I think we need to work harder to establish relationships with all the fast exit relays. We're doing pretty well in terms of knowing the operators of the CCC relays, the Torservers.net relays, the Akamai relays, etc. Will we eventually get to the point where we can cap the bandwidth weights for relays that we haven't met personally? Perhaps we can even bring back the Named or Valid flags for real? In any case, the short-term answer is \"send them mail and start a conversation\".</li>\n<li>I talked to trams about <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7008#comment:5\">sandboxing Flash</a>. It would be great to ship the Tor Browser Bundle with some wrappers that prevent Flash from doing scary things. (Ok, it would be even better to <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7681\">wrap the whole OS</a>, but let's not get hasty.) He has a set of protection wrappers that work on OS X, but his next question is what behaviors to allow? I suggested that to start, we should pick exactly the behaviors Youtube uses &mdash; then we'll make a lot of Tor users happier while still not opening the attack surface too much. Next messy steps include \"that's nice for OS X users, but what about Windows users?\" and \"How does this relate to FF17's new <a href=\"http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/What%20is%20plugin-container\">plugin-container</a> notion?\"</li>\n<li>I met with the Wau Holland Foundation board about having WHF be our European coordinator for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2012-July/001433.html\">exit relay funding</a>. It's tricky to get everything organized in a way that's compatible with non-profit laws in both the US and Germany, and also in a way where the community understands how the relationships work. We're getting closer.</li>\n<li>I met with Andy Isaacson of <a href=\"https://www.noisebridge.net/\">Noisebridge</a>, which operates several fast exits in the US under its <a href=\"http://noisetor.net/\">Noisetor</a> project. I'd like to sign Noisebridge up to be a US-based coordinator for exit relay funding. But Andy quite reasonably worries that once we start giving Noisetor money for exits, the individual contributions they get to run their exits will disappear. One resolution might be to do one of those \"matching funding\" deals, where we offer to match every dollar they raise up to some amount.  Ultimately, I hope they work with their community to make a plan that lets them either grow the capacity or diversity of the relays they run, or extend the lifetime of their existing relays.</li>\n<li>I talked to bunnie about the <a href=\"http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=2686\">open laptop</a> he's working on. Over in <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/Torouter\">Torouter land</a>, we've had a series of experiences where we pick what looks like a fine architecture for a tiny Tor relay. We work with the vendor, help everything go smoothly, and then at the last minute it seems like the vendor goes sideways with some for-profit proprietary alternate plan. :( I really want to live in a world where a fully open platform exists &mdash; hardware design and documentation, firmware, device drivers, software, everything. If you can do anything to help bunnie succeed, please do!</li>\n</ul>"

    "content": "<p>Over the weekend, I attended the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hacking-against-domestic-violence\">Hacking against Domestic Violence</a> event in Washington DC, sponsored by the World Bank and Second Muse. I was there to help define problem statements, think about security and privacy risks of the solutions, and to help judge the solutions crafted by the attendees. A total of 10 teams congealed over the weekend. Everyone had creative solutions to the problem statements. Generally the sheer quality of output and enthusiasm was the first thing I noticed about all of the teams and their apps. Everyone in DC focused on mobile phone compatibility, even if their solution worked on the general web itself. There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/vdhackathon/\">photos</a> available from the 7 involved countries.</p>\n<p>I ended up spending most of my time with the team working to <a href=\"http://vdhackathon.pbworks.com/w/page/62827130/Protocols%20to%20Protect%20Survivors%20from%20Surveillance\">develop protocols to protect survivors from surveillance</a>. We called ourselves Team Fuerza. The <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~andrew/2013-01-27-dvhackathon/2013-01-27-presentation.html\">full presentation</a> is available. A volunteer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6x9ubvC4Ai8\">recorded a video</a> of the presentation as well. Related images and videos are uploaded to my <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~andrew/2013-01-27-dvhackathon/\">Tor people site</a>.</p>\n<p>Because I was involved with a team, I volunteered to give up my voting rights on the judges panel to avoid any issues. I then ended up presenting for the team for the status update and final presentation.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a great two days and the team made a lot of progress in a short amount of time. A big thanks to <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~andrew/2013-01-27-dvhackathon/WorldBankTeamFuerza-smile.jpg\">the team</a> (Sarah, Az, Cid, Adriana, Andrew, and Justin), SecondMuse, the World Bank, and all of the attendees for their efforts in holding a hackathon in 7 countries simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The World Bank and Second Muse should have their final press release and announcement of the results soon.</p>\n<p>UPDATE 2013-02-08: World Bank accounces their <a href=\"http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2013/01/22/domestic-violence-hackathon-smartphone-lifesaver\">press release</a> about the hackathon.

One of the challenges when dealing with online threats (cybercrime/e-crime) is understanding which leads not to follow. My goal was to help them understand what Tor is, how it works (both from a user and a relay operator point of view), and what it can and cannot do.</p>\n<p>I talked about the Tor software ecosystem, including <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">ExoneraTor</a> (the website that tells you whether a given IP address was a Tor relay), and mentioned that we list all <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/projects.html.en\" rel=\"nofollow\">official projects</a> on our website. I also mentioned Roger’s trip to the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/trip-report-october-fbi-conference\" rel=\"nofollow\">FBI conference</a> in October 2012, and talked about some of the experiences we have had teaching US-based law enforcement about Tor.</p>\n<p>Overall, I would say the meeting went well. They learned more about Tor and the projects we are working on, and they are aware that the protections that prevent us from figuring out what Tor users are doing - and who they are - is what’s keeping all Tor users safe.</p>"

I also met with the team behind <a href=\"http://zerodaydoc.com/\">Zero Day</a>, a documentary about all things Internet security, to talk about Tor and the work that I do.</p>\n<p>I met with foreign journalists on the first day and local journalists the day after. Around 30 people attended in total, and each training session lasted just over two hours. <a href=\"http://encrypted.cc/2013-01-28-istanbul.pdf\">My presentation</a> covered threats, how you can protect your communication, local data, and external data, as well as how to use the Tor Browser Bundle and Tails. I gave out USB sticks with the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en\">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/manual/short-user-manual_en.xhtml\">the short user manual</a>, and the <a href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2012/04/journalist-security-guide.php\">CPJ Journalist Security Guide</a>. PC users were also given USB sticks with <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/\">Tails</a>.</p>\n<h2>Presentation</h2>\n<p>The feedback has been really positive from everyone who attended, and I have been told that those who were unable to attend have been given the material I handed out. There are some things that can be improved, however:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tor does not prevent somebody watching your Internet traffic from learning that you’re using Tor. In some cases, the fact that you are using Tor and encrypting emails/chat/drives can be a red flag. I am not sure how to best address this in a presentation, other than just say that yes, it can be a red flag.</li>\n<li>We talked about a few different risks, such as having your phone tapped, your email hacked, and your home or hotel room broken into. Having solid examples and stories helps a lot.</li>\n<li>I introduced a lot of new technology in a short amount of time. Those who are not familiar with technology such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption\">full disk encryption</a>, <a href=\"http://www.gnupg.org/\">GPG</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/\">OTR</a>, would benefit from a longer and more hands-on session.</li>\n<li>The presentation included screenshots of encrypted email, encrypted chat, and the Tor Browser Bundle. Having a few videos that illustrate how it works, what the user sees, and what the new workflow is will make it easier to understand.</li>\n<li>The presentation mentioned <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitlocker\">Bitlocker</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FileVault\">FileVault</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.truecrypt.org/\">TrueCrypt</a> for full disk encryption, but did not go into details. I told everyone how to enable FileVault in OS X, and I should add these step-by-step instructions to the presentation.</li>\n<li>Tor was originally designed, implemented, and deployed as a project of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory. We also receive funding via U.S. government organizations. I covered this briefly in my presentation, but could have spent a bit more time talking about the Tor Project, Inc and why we are qualified to talk about Internet security and online anonymity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Tails</h2>\n<p>I asked a few people to try out Tails and let me know if something was confusing, did not work, or could be improved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tails has <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/support/known_issues/index.en.html#index1h2\">very limited support</a> for Apple hardware. 23 out of 30 attendees were Mac users. I tried booting Tails on my MacBook Air, but OS X was unable to find the USB stick.</li>\n<li>I am used to the Tor Browser and was surprised to see that <a href=\"https://check.torproject.org\">check.torproject.org</a> was not the default home page.</li>\n<li>Firefox will start automatically once you are connected to the Internet. Most users did not wait for the Tails website to load before entering another URL in the address bar. Users did not question if they were actually using Tor.</li>\n<li>One user waited for the Tails website to load, saw the green download button and then asked if he needed to upgrade to a newer version. I wonder if there is a way to let users know which version they are currently using.</li>\n<li>A few users seemed confused when Pidgin automatically connected to IRC. I wonder if it would be better to have that disabled by default, and instead take users through the process of setting up their own accounts.</li>\n<li>One user tried the email client, skipped the part where you set up the mail servers, and tried to write an email. I wonder if there is a way to improve this, as most users expect the mail client to work just like the one they are used to in their normal operating system.</li>\n<li>Tails uses a US keyboard layout by default. This can be confusing for anyone with a different keyboard layout. A few users mentioned that the tap-touchpad-to-click functionality did not work.</li>\n<li>One user pointed out that there is no logout or shutdown option available when using Tails in Windows XP mode.</li>\n<li>The shutdown process can look a bit scary for anyone who is not used to Linux, especially the part where it wipes the memory. A friendly splash-screen of some sort would be good.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks to my wonderful hosts for providing me with a place to stay, great food, suggestions on what to see in Istanbul, and for organizing and hosting the training sessions.</p>"

    "content": "<p>In January I did Tor talks for the Dutch regional police, the Dutch national police, and the Belgian national police. Jake and I also did a brief inspirational talk at <a href=\"https://www.bof.nl/home/english-bits-of-freedom/\">Bits of Freedom</a>, as well as the closing keynote for the Dutch <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.nl/english\">National Cyber Security Centre</a>'s yearly <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.nl/english/conference\">conference</a>.</p>\n<p>You may recall that one of my side hobbies lately has been teaching law enforcement about Tor &mdash; see my previous entries about <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/trip-report-october-fbi-conference\">teaching the FBI about Tor</a> in 2012 and visiting the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/talking-german-police-stuttgart\">Stuttgart</a> detectives in 2008 back when we were discussing data retention in Germany. Before this blog started I also did several Tor talks for the US DoJ, and even one for the Norwegian <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Criminal_Investigation_Service_%28Norway%29\">Kripos</a>.</p>\n<p>Now is a good time to talk to the Dutch police, first because they're still smarting from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DigiNotar\">DigiNotar disaster</a> in 2011, but second because of their 2012 ambitions to <a href=\"https://www.bof.nl/2012/10/18/dutch-proposal-to-search-and-destroy-foreign-computers/\">legalize</a> breaking into foreign computers when they aren't sure what country they're in. (I say legalize because <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2011-September/021198.html\">they already did it!</a>)</p>\n<p>Below are some discussion points that made an impression on me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nI started the trip with a <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/~arma/slides-dex13.pdf\">talk</a> to about 80 people from the Dutch regional police. Apparently each regional police group has basically one cybercrime person, and pretty much all of them came to learn about Tor. These are the people who advise their police groups about how to handle Tor cases, so they're exactly the ones who need to know about services like <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/exonerator.html\">ExoneraTor</a>.  (Afterwards, one of the national police thanked me heartily for teaching the regional police about Tor, since it makes *his* job easier.)\n</li>\n<li>\nOne issue that came up repeatedly during the talks: what if a bad guy runs a Tor exit relay to provide plausible deniability when somebody shows up as his door? My first thought is that anybody who runs a Tor exit relay in order to attract *less* attention from the police is crazy: if you want to be ignored, you should use a botnet or whatever to do your bad things, nobody will learn that it's you, end of story. Until we educate every law enforcement person on the planet about Tor, there will always be people who raid every IP address on their suspect list without ever knowing what Tor is. The second point they found interesting was that Tor relays never write any traffic to disk; so if your suspect has bad stuff on his hard drive and says it was because of the Tor relay, he's lying. Of course, disk encryption complicates the situation (which is why, counterintuitively, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorExitGuidelines\">we recommend *not* using disk encryption</a> on your exit).\n</li>\n<li>\nDid you know that the Dutch police have their own internal anonymity network? They started out using a secret subnet (\"nobody knows that it's the Dutch police, until somebody figures out that it is\"). Apparently now they do smarter things like grabbing addresses from Dutch ISPs so they can blend in better. But that's still not perfect: if they borrow an IP address for 36 hours, then that's a 36-hour window where if you can recognize any of the traffic as Dutch police, you can link the rest of the traffic to them too. I hear their new generation of client-side software has an option for using Tor; I wonder if that means the Tor Browser Bundle, or just tunnelling the traffic through Tor naked? More details <a href=\"https://www.security.nl/artikel/41028/1/Politieprovider_laat_agenten_anoniem_rechercheren.html\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nctv.nl/Images/security-infrastructure-for-irn_tcm126-444149.pdf\">here</a>. (Two points for transparency and open standards!)\n</li>\n<li>\nWhen we met with the US DEA earlier in January, many people there said they use Tor for their job. Most people in the Dutch national police meeting said they used it often. On the other hand, most people in the Dutch regional police meeting said they certainly did not use it, \"because that would be inappropriate.\" We have some more educating left to do.\n</li>\n<li>\nOne regional Dutch police woman told us that they know how to check if it's a Tor exit IP, but sometimes they do the raid anyway \"to discourage people from helping Tor.\" I later told that statement to one of the national police, and he was shocked, said that was illegal, and said he'd look into it. Alas, I'm not optimistic that anything will come of it: giving investigators discretion about how to act can be both good and bad.\n</li>\n<li>\nIt took me a few hours to get the regional police comfortable enough to discuss, but by the end they were answering each other's questions &mdash; which is one of my main goals, since I won't be there later to answer them. The best example was one detective who stood up and explained that in his opinion they are focusing way too much on Tor (\"because we can't break it\"), while at the same time there are many other crimes they *can* fight, like criminals using file sharing networks, and they're ignoring those. Certainly Tor gets a lot of publicity (last year a <a href=\"http://www.sbs6.nl/programmas/undercover-in-nederland/over\">Dutch TV show</a> stirred up a media fear frenzy about Tor that resulted in a Dutch Parliament member calling to ban it), but according to this detective there's a lot more crime elsewhere. My response: \"Did everybody hear that?\" It works best when police hear statements like this from their peers rather than from me.\n</li>\n<li>\nHere's an argument based on discussions with Karen Reilly for responding about child porn and banning Tor. A lot of people think that it's about trading off the good for the bad. On the one hand, you have a girl in Syria who is alive right now because of Tor. On the other hand, you have a girl in America who is harmed by some jerk and the jerk uses Tor. So, how do you balance these two? How do you decide which one is more important, or more 'valuable' to the world? The answer is that it's the wrong question to ask: you aren't actually going to save the girl in America by getting rid of Tor. Whereas getting rid of Tor *would* harm the girl in Syria (along with a wide variety of people and groups around the world).\n</li>\n<li>\nThe day after I did the talk to the regional police, I did a short talk at <a href=\"https://www.bof.nl/home/english-bits-of-freedom/\">Bits of Freedom</a>, an EFF-like digital rights nonprofit in Amsterdam. They held a \"Boffel\" for many of their supporters to show up and socialize. It was a really great crowd &mdash; these are smart people who care. It was like a tiny <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/trip-report-29c3\">CCC</a> congress.  And now that I've been clearly complimentary to them, you'll be able to properly interpret my next statement: many of the Dutch police would have fit in just fine at the Boffel. People came up to me at the NCSC conference days later and said \"I liked your talk!\" and I genuinely couldn't tell if they meant my talk at the regional police or my talk at Bits of Freedom. There were some exceptions, sure, but most of the Dutch police I talked to have somehow managed to not get ground down by their job and lose track of the civil liberties angle. I wonder what their trick is.\n</li>\n<li>\nRejo Zenger (from BoF) and two others are working to create a Dutch organization to run fast Tor exit relays, to gather donations and centrally handle abuse complaints &mdash; like <a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/\">Zwiebelfreunde</a> in Germany, <a href=\"http://nos-oignons.net/\">Nos Oignons</a> in France, <a href=\"https://dfri.se/\">DFRI</a> in Sweden, and <a href=\"http://noisetor.net/\">NoiseTor</a> in the US. That's great! Please help them out however you can.\n</li>\n<li>\nAt the NCSC conference, Jake and I did an open Q&amp;A session on the first day, and did the closing keynote (<a href=\"http://freehaven.net/~arma/slides-ncsc13.pdf\">slides</a>) on the second day. Both talks went very well (imagine what would happen if Jake and I practiced any of our talks together before giving them! :). We now have invites to come to all sorts of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERT_Coordination_Center\">CERTs</a> around the world; the woman managing the conference is moving to Europol shortly and wants us to come talk there; and one of the heads of NCSC wants us to come back and help the Netherlands with their general direction and strategy. We should try to connect them to local Dutch Tor advocates as much as we can, since after all we have software to write.\n</li>\n<li>\nI'm afraid I missed most of the other talks at the conference (and I missed the <a href=\"http://alt-s.nl/\">alternate conference</a> entirely), but I did see <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.nl/english/conference/conference-2013/speakers/peter-zinn.html\">Peter Zinn</a>'s well-choreographed talk about what the Dutch national police should be focusing on. His conclusion was that the Netherlands should focus on being the \"safest country in the world wrt cybercrime by 2017\". I had to restrain myself from yelling out the word <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality\">externalities!</a> during his talk: if their plan is to convince cybercriminals to go elsewhere, and then the neighboring countries like Belgium become cyber-hives-of-scum-and-villainy, that's not going to end well for anybody.\n</li>\n<li>\nOne person in the Belgian FCCU (Federal Computer Crime Unit) suggested during a break in the discussion that maybe Belgium should block all connections from the Tor network *to* any Belgian IP space. By now there's almost no such thing as a new question for me during these talks, but I have to admit that this one took me by surprise. Eventually I produced the right answer: \"The Internet community would destroy you. 'Great Firewall of Belgium'? 'Adopt a Belgian dissident'? Nobody would take you seriously again as an alleged democracy.\" In any case, my friend at RIPE tells me that technically, it's harder than it sounds for Belgium to do this scale of blocking.\n</li>\n<li>\nI got into a discussion with the Belgian police about how they don't regard their Internet filtering as \"censorship\". In my experience, the way it starts is some legislators decide there's something so horrible on the Internet that it justifies filtering. From there, they delegate to some quasi-governmental organization which comes up with a list (in some totally non-transparent fashion) of verboten URLs. Inevitably, the list contains <a href=\"http://thepiratebay.se/blog/195\">more types of content</a> than the original reason for setting up the filtering; and inevitably, there's no redress mechanism to get off the list if you <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/dentists-website-on-leaked-blacklist-20090319-93cl.html\">shouldn't be on it</a>. The Belgian police assured me that they only filter a small set of URLs, and that each of them is discussed and transparently decided about in a democratic fashion. And then they wouldn't tell me what's on their list.\n</li>\n<li>\nI met a US FBI agent and a US Secret Service agent who are \"permanently\" stationed with the Dutch national police. They acted just like normal Dutch police, except I guess they're paid by the United States to be Dutch police. Weird world we live in.\n</li>\n<li>\nIn each of the three police meetings, somebody suggested an alternate model for Tor where a judge should get to decide whether a given Tor user should be <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#Backdoor\">deanonymized</a>.  (While in America we don't trust our judges, in Europe they really do.) Putting aside for a moment the technical fact that building in a backdoor would mean that criminals can exploit it too (this argument doesn't work on them), I tried to press on the multi-jurisdictional aspect: we have governments, militaries, and law enforcement from around the world relying on Tor. When I asked the embedded Secret Service guy if he would be ok with the Dutch police having a backdoor to Tor, he said \"We like our Dutch colleagues.\" When I rephrased it to whether he would be ok with the Dutch police knowing what the US police are using Tor for, he paused, smiled, and tactfully said \"No comment.\"\n</li>\n<li>\nSeveral people at the Dutch cybercrime unit quietly told me they regretted their \"break into a Tor hidden service and zero it out\" action: it got people upset at them, but more importantly, it *didn't work*. That is, it didn't stop any bad people from doing bad things. Apparently playing whack-a-mole like this doesn't make the criminals go away. And worse, it disrupts the police's other monitoring and infiltration operations.\n</li>\n<li>\nIf I wanted to run a hidden service website that had a nation-state adversary, I would a) run a good solid webserver like nginx; b) run it in a VM, in a way that the VM couldn't learn its location &mdash; \"no looking up its IP\", but also more subtle things like \"no looking up nameservers\", \"no looking up reachable wireless access points\", etc; and then c) put that VM in a VPS running in a country that hates my adversary. That way even if somebody breaks into the webserver and breaks out of the VM, they're still faced with a frustratingly long bureaucratic step.\n</li>\n<li>\nI took Aaron Gibson and Pepijn Le Heux with me to the Brussels meeting, and took Pepijn again to the Dutch national police meeting. Pepijn is a great guy; I'm hoping to turn him into a Roger replica so he can act as a Dutch Tor resource and so he can help organizations like Bits of Freedom save their country.\n</li>\n</ul>"

Analyzing and circumventing these blocks typically requires detailed packet traces or access to machines inside censoring countries. Both, however, are not always easy to acquire:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\nNetwork traces are problematic for two reasons. First, they are difficult to obtain since they require the cooperation of users within censoring countries. Second, they are hard to anonymize and must not fall into wrong hands. Derived information, such as <a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/image/blog-images/2012-05-31-ethiopia-dpi-blocking-of-tor.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">flow diagrams</a>, is typically safe to publish but frequently lacks important information.\n</li>\n<li>\nThe alternative to network traces is to gain access to machines inside the censoring regime. This approach turns out to be difficult as well; mostly due to the lack of volunteers who could provide machines or the lack of VPS providers and open SOCKS proxies.\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These problems show that there is a strong need for a lightweight tool which can assist in analyzing censorship events. This tool should be run by censored users and perform several tests to gain a rough understanding of how and if Tor could be blocked in the respective network. The results of these tests should make it back to the Tor project and would be used to improve circumvention technology such as <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en\" rel=\"nofollow\">obfsproxy</a> and to <a href=\"https://censorshipwiki.torproject.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">document censorship</a>.</p>\n<p>We created a <a href=\"https://research.torproject.org/techreports/censorship-analysis-tool-2013-02-06.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">technical report which discusses the design requirements for such a censorship analysis tool</a>.  We list the desired features, discuss how they can be implemented and we give a rough overview of the software design. After all, this technical report should serve as basis for the development and deployment of the censorship analysis tool.</p>"

    "content": "<p>I attended the <a href=\"https://cryptoparty.org/wiki/Stockholm\">Stockholm Cryptoparty</a> on Saturday the 16th of February. I was asked to give the opening talk, &quot;Varför krypto?&quot;, to start off the day. My goal was to explain why cryptography should be used daily by everyone in mundane ways. The general topic was about how I watch kids using cryptography daily, without knowing it or without fully understanding the technical details behind it. This is ok. Kids chat a lot. When you introduce <a href=\"http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/\">Off-the-record</a> to their chats, they instantly understand that the chats are now private, and can be authenticated. The distinction between the two concepts is fairly easy to grasp, even if they don't understand the details of hashes, key exchanges, or ciphers. Once a few core people start using OTR, for example, then it spreads to their friends and soon you have networks of kids using OTR having safe and secure chats.</p>\n<p>The simplest three steps people can take to begin using cryptography daily are:</p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal\">\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\">https everywhere</a> in your browser.</li>\n<li>Use a browser password manager. <a href=\"http://keepass.info/\">KeePass</a> is as good as any. The point is to keep username/passwords unique and complex per site/service.

Many people were new to cryptoparties and new to cryptography in general. It was a great time. As an American, it was nice to see about 50% women attending. There were a number of younger kids learning about all of this too. The cryptoparties I've attended in the USA have been all men and the maybe one girlfriend or wife dragged to the event.</p>\n<p>(Unfortunately, the camera recording my talk malfunctioned and corrupted the video.

Both of these technologies make it harder to block access to Tor. If you previously used the obfsproxy bundle, please upgrade to this bundle, which in addition to flash proxy has new obfsproxy bridges.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto\">Flash proxy works differently</a> from other pluggable transports, and you need to take extra steps to make it work. In particular, <strong>you will probably need to configure port forwarding</strong> in order to receive connections from browser proxies. There are instructions and hints on how to do that at this page: <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto\">flash proxy howto</a>.</p>\n<p>These bundles contain the same hardcoded obfs2 bridge addresses as the previous bundles which may work for some jurisdictions but you are strongly advised to get new bridge addresses from BridgeDB: <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/?transport=obfs2\" title=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/?transport=obfs2\">https://bridges.torproject.org/?transport=obfs2</a>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we are looking for feedback on how the bundles work. Please leave comments on the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyUsability\">flash proxy usability wiki page</a> or <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7824\">ticket #7824</a> with your experience, good or bad.</p>\n<p>There are other ways you can help beyond testing the bundles. One is to <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/asn/pyobfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/HOWTO.txt\">run a bridge with pyobfsproxy</a>. Another is to <a href=\"http://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/#badge-howto\">put the flash proxy badge</a> on your web site or blog, or <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/flashproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/modules/mediawiki/custom.js\">add it to your Wikipedia profile</a>. If you want your browser to continue to be a proxy after a switch to an opt-in model, click the “Yes” button on <a href=\"http://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/options.html\">the options page</a>.</p>"

This post will cover Debian Linux (<a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8166\">#8166</a>), part two will cover Windows 7, and part three will cover OS X 10.8.</p>\n<h3>Process</h3>\n<p>I set up a virtual machine with a fresh install of Debian 6.0 Squeeze, logged in once and shut it down cleanly. I then connected the virtual drive to another virtual machine and used <em>dd</em> to create an image of the drive. I also used <em>hashdeep</em> to compute hashes for every file on the drive, and <em>rsync</em> to copy all the files over to an external drive.</p>\n<p>After having secured a copy of the clean virtual machine, I rebooted the system, connected an external drive, and copied the Tor Browser Bundle (version 2.3.25-6, 64-bit) from the external drive to my Debian home directory. I extracted the package archive and started the Tor Browser Bundle by running </em>./start-tor-browser</em> inside the Tor Browser directory.</p>\n<p>Once the Tor Browser was up and running, I browsed to a few pages, read a few paragraphs here and there, clicked on a few links, and then shut it down by closing the Tor Browser and clicking on the <em>Exit</em>-button in Vidalia. The Tor Browser did not crash and I did not see any error messages. I deleted the Tor Browser directory and the tarball using <em>rm -rf</em>.</p>\n<p>I repeated the steps with <em>dd</em>, <em>hashdeep</em>, and <em>rsync</em> to create a copy of the tainted virtual machine.</p>\n<h3>Results</h3>\n<p>Using <em>hashdeep</em>, I compared the hashes from the tainted virtual machine against the hashes from the clean virtual machine: <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/attachment/ticket/8166/debian_changed_files.txt\">68 files</a> had a hash that did not match any of the hashes in the clean set. The most interesting files are:</p>\n<p><strong>~/.local/share/gvfs-metadata/home</strong>: contains the filename of the Tor Browser Bundle tarball: <em>tor-browser-gnu-linux-x86_64-2.3.25-5-dev-en-US.tar.gz</em>. GVFS is the virtual filesystem for the GNOME desktop, so this result will probably vary depending on the window manager used. I have created <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8695\">#8695</a> for this issue.</p>\n<p><strong>~/.xsession-errors</strong>: contains the following string: <em>“Window manager warning: Buggy client sent a _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW message with a timestamp of 0 for 0x3800089 (Tor Browse)”</em>. It is worth noting that a file named <em>.xsession-errors.old</em> could also exist. I have created <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8696\">#8696</a> for this issue.</p>\n<p><strong>~/.bash_history</strong>: contains a record of commands typed into the terminal. I started the Tor Browser Bundle from the command line, so this file contains lines such as <em>./start-tor-browser</em>. I have created <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8697\">#8697</a> for this issue.</p>\n<p><strong>/var/log/daemon.log</strong>, <strong>/var/log/syslog</strong>, <strong>/var/log/kern.log</strong>, <strong>/var/log/messages</strong>: contains information about attached devices. I had an external drive attached to the virtual machine, so these files contain lines such as <em>“Mounted /dev/sdb1 (Read-Write, label “THA”, NTFS 3.1)”</em> and <em>“Initializing USB Mass Storage driver…”</em>.</p>"

I've been part of a task force to look at the role of technology in human trafficking. Secretary of State John Kerry sent <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2013/04/207232.htm\">a video</a> since he was in another country at the time. A local Tor volunteer from Cambridge, Massachusetts has White House Press credentials and was able to <a href=\"http://cctvcambridge.org/WhiteHouseTor\">cover the event</a>. This article is a better writeup and interview, with video, than anything else I've seen covering the event. Interestingly, no other press showed up to cover the event. It seems <a href=\"http://cctvcambridge.org/\">CCTV Cambridge</a> was the only press covering this White House initiative.</p>\n<p>The room was full of a mix of people from law enforcement, human rights organizations, legal firms, and commercial companies. Eric Holder, Attorney General of US, Janet Napolitano, Secretary of DHS, and Cecilia Munoz, Director of Domestic Policy Council, all gave speeches about what their respective organizations are doing to fight trafficking. The US Dept of Health and Human Services is the main organization behind all of this. Their <a href=\"http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/endtrafficking\">end trafficking</a> site is a fine starting point.</p>\n<p>As far as my role, it's been to think about how technology is being used by traffickers and how victims could get help in their situations. <a href=\"http://wearethorn.org/aboutus/\">Thorn</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fairgirls.org/\">FAIR Girls</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.polarisproject.org/media-center/press-releases/757-texting-increases-human-trafficking-victims-access-to-help\">Polaris</a> are all working on solutions and gathering raw data to support decisions.</p>\n<p>I then spent some time talking to various organizations in DC and helping to explain Tor to more law enforcement.</p>\n<p>Overall, it was a good day trip to DC.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Hidden Services are in a peculiar situation. While they see a loyal fan-base, there are no dedicated Tor developers to take care of them. This results in a big pile of features that need to be researched, implemented and deployed to make Hidden Services more secure and effective.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this blog post is threefold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduce Hidden Service operators to various shortcomings of the Hidden Service architecture.</li>\n<li>Introduce researchers to various research questions regarding Hidden Services.</li>\n<li>Introduce developers to the plethora of coding tasks left to be done in the hidden Service ecosystem.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Note that not every idea listed in the blog post is going to turn out to be a great idea. This post is more of a brain-dump than a solid fully-analyzed agenda.</p>\n<p>In any case, let's get down to the issues:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<hr>\n<br></p>\n<h3>Hidden Service Scaling</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The current Hidden Services architecture does not scale well. Ideally, big websites should have the option to completely migrate to Tor Hidden Services, but this is not possible with their current architecture.</p>\n<p>One of the main problems with a busy Hidden Service is that its Introduction Points will get hammered by clients. Since Introduction Points are regular Tor relays, they are not intended to handle such load.</p>\n<p>Therefore, one of the first steps for improving Hidden Services scalability is increasing the durability of its Introduction Points. Currently, a Hidden Service selects the number of its Introduction Points (between one and ten) based on a self-estimation of its own popularity. Whether <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/src/or/rendservice.c?id=42b42605f8d8eac25361be229354f6393967df4f#n1032\">the formula currently used</a> is the best such formula is an open research question.</p>\n<p>Another problem with Hidden Services is the lack of load balancing options. While you can load-balance a Hidden Service using TCP/HTTP load balancers (like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAProxy\">HAProxy</a>), there is no load-balancing option similar to DNS round-robin, where load balancing happens by sending clients to different server IP addresses. Such load-balancing could be achieved by allowing a Hidden Service to have multiple \"subservices\".  Such an architecture, although appealing, introduces multiple problems, like the intercommunication between subservices, where the long-term keypair is stored, how introduction points are assigned, etc.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Defense against Denial of Service of Introduction Points</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The adversarial version of the previous section involves attackers intentionally hammering the Introduction Points of a Hidden Service to make it unreachable by honest clients. This means that an attacker can temporarily bring down a Hidden Service by DoSing a small number of Tor relays.</p>\n<p>To defend against such attacks, Syverson and Øverlier introduced <em>Valet nodes</em> in their PETS 2006 paper: <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#valet:pet2006\"><em>\"Valet Services: Improving Hidden Servers with a Personal Touch\"</em></a>.  <em>Valet nodes</em> stand in front of Introduction Points and act as a protection layer. This allows Hidden Services to maintain a limited number of Introduction Points, but many more contact points, without clients learning the actual addresses of the Introduction Points.</p>\n<p>Valet nodes are not implemented yet, mainly because of the big implementation and deployment effort they require.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Key Length</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The long-term keypair of a Hidden Service is an RSA-1024 keypair which nowadays is considered weak. This means that in the future, Hidden Services will need to migrate to a different keysize and/or asymmetric cryptographic algorithm.</p>\n<p>A side effect of such migration is that Hidden Services will get a different onion address, which might be troublesome for Hidden Services that have a well-established onion address. To make the transition smoother, Hidden Services should be able to use both old and new keypairs for a while to be able to point their clients to the new address.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, while design work has started on <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/ideas/xxx-crypto-migration.txt\">strengthening some</a> <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/ideas/xxx-new-crypto-sketch.txt\">parts of Tor's cryptography</a>, there are no proposals on improving the cryptography of Hidden Services yet.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Attacks by Hidden Service Directory Servers</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Hidden Services upload their descriptor to Tor nodes called <em>Hidden Service Directory Servers</em> (HSDirs). Clients then fetch that descriptor and use it to connect to the Hidden Service.</p>\n<p>In the current system, HSDirs are in an interesting position which allows them to perform the following actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Learn the .onion address of a Hidden Service and connect to it</li>\n<li>Evaluate the popularity of a Hidden Service by tracking the number of clients who do a lookup for that Hidden Service</li>\n<li>Refuse to answer a client, and if enough HSDirs do this then the Hidden Service is temporarily unreachable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These scenarios are explored in the upcoming IEEE S&amp;P paper titled <em>\"Trawling for Tor Hidden Services: Detection, Measurement, Deanonymization\"</em> from Alex Biryukov, Ivan Pustogarov and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann. Be sure to check it out (once they publish it)!</p>\n<p>Let's look at some suggested fixes for the attacks that Hidden Service Directory Servers can perform:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h4>Defences against enumeration of onion addresses</h4>\n<p>Hidden Services use a <a href=\"http://www.martinbroadhurst.com/Consistent-Hash-Ring.html\">hash ring</a> to choose which HSDirs will host their descriptor; this means that HSDirs can just wait to get picked by Hidden Services and then collect their descriptors and onion addresses. Also, since the hash ring is rotating, HSDirs get new Hidden Service descriptors in every rotation period.</p>\n<p>One possible solution to this issue would be to append a symmetric key to the onion address and use it to encrypt the descriptor before sending it to HSDirs (similar to how <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/121-hidden-service-authentication.txt\">descriptor-cookie authentication</a> works currently). A client that knows the onion address can decrypt the descriptor, but an HSDir who doesn't know the onion address can't derive the Hidden Service name. The drawback of this scheme is that the size of onion addresses will increase without increasing the security of their <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/HiddenServiceNames#Whyare.onionnamescreatedthatway\">self-authentication property</a>.  Furthermore, HSDirs will still be able to extract the Hidden Service public key from the descriptor, which allows HSDirs to track the descriptors of specific Hidden Services.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8106#comment:1\">different solution</a> was proposed by Robert Ransom:</p>\n<p>Robert's scheme uses the long-term keypair of a Hidden Service to derive (in a one-way fashion) a second keypair, which is used to encrypt and sign the descriptor that is uploaded to the HSDirs. This construction allows the HSDir, without knowing the long-term keypair of the Hidden Service or the contents of its descriptor, to validate that the entity who uploaded the descriptor had possession of the long-term private key of the Hidden Service. A client who knows the long-term public key of the Hidden Service can fetch the descriptor from the HSDir and verify that it was created by the Hidden Service itself. See the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8106\">relevant trac ticket</a> for a more robust analysis of the idea.</p>\n<p>Robert's idea increases the size of onion addresses, but also makes them more resistant to impersonation attacks (the current 80-bit security of onion addresses does not inspire confidence against impresonation attacks). Furthermore, his idea does not allow HSDirs to track Hidden Service descriptors across time.</p>\n<p>While Robert's scheme is fairly straightforward, a proper security evaluation is in order and a Tor proposal needs to be written. For extra fun, his idea requires the long-term keypair of the Hidden Service to use a discrete-log cryptosystem, which means that a keypair migration will be needed if we want to proceed with this plan.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h4>Block tracking of popularity of Hidden Services</h4>\n<p>HSDirs can track the number of users who do a lookup for a Hidden Service, thereby learning how popular they are. We can make it harder for HSDirs to track the popularity of a Hidden Service, by utilizing a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_information_retrieval\">Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocol</a> for Hidden Service descriptor fetches. Of course, this won't stop the Introduction Points of a Hidden Service from doing the tracking, but since the Introduction Points were picked by the Hidden Service itself, the threat is smaller.</p>\n<p>If we wanted to block Introduction Points from tracking the popularity of Hidden Services, we could attempt hiding the identity of the Hidden Service from its Introduction Points by using a cookie scheme, similar to how the Rendezvous is currently done, or by using Robert's keypair derivation trick and signing the introduction establishment with the new keypair. A careful security evaluation of these ideas is required.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h4>Make it harder to become an adversarial HSDir</h4>\n<p>Because of the security implications that HSDirs have for a Hidden Services, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8243\">we started working</a> on making it harder for a Tor relay to become an HSDir node.</p>\n<p>Also, currently, an adversary can predict the identity keys it will need in the future to target a <em>specific</em> Hidden Service.  <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8244\">We started thinking of ways</a> to avoid this attack.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Performance improvements</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Hidden services are slooooowwww and we don't even understand why.  They might be slow because of the expensive setup process of creating a Hidden Service circuit, or because Hidden Service circuits have 6 hops, or because of something else.  Many suggestions have been proposed to reduce the latency of Hidden Services, ranging from <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/155-four-hidden-service-improvements.txt\">Hidden Service protocol hacks</a> to <a href=\"https://github.com/hellais/latenza.js\">Javascript hacks</a>, and to radically changing how the Hidden Service circuit is formed.</p>\n<p>Let's investigate some of these proposals:</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h4>Reducing Hidden Service Circuit Setup complexity</h4>\n<p>During PETS 2007 Syverson and Øverlier presented \"<em>Improving Efficiency and Simplicity of Tor circuit establishment and hidden services</em>\" which simplifies Hidden Service circuit establishmentby eliminating the need of a separate rendezvous connection.</p>\n<p>They noticed that by using <em>Valet nodes</em>, the concept of Rendezvous Points is redundant and that a Hidden Service circuit can be formed by just using <em>Valet nodes</em> and Introduction Points. Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/142-combine-intro-and-rend-points.txt\">wrote a Tor proposal</a> for a variant of this idea.</p>\n<p>The reason this scheme is not implemented is that the security trade-offs introduced are not well understood, and there are also some technical obstacles (like the fact that sharing of circuits between multiple clients is not currently supported).</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h4>Analyze Hidden Service Circuit Establishment Timing With Torperf</h4>\n<p>Establishing a connection to a hidden service currently involves two Tor relays, the introduction and rendezvous point, and 10 more relays distributed over four circuits to connect to them. No one has really researched how much time Tor spends in each step of that complicated process. It wouldn't be surprising if a large amount of time is spent in an unexpected part of the process.</p>\n<p>To investigate this properly, one should use <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torperf.git\">Torperf</a> to analyze the timing delta between the steps of the process. Unfortunately, Torperf uses controller events to distinguish between Tor protocol phases but not all steps of the Hidden Service circuit setup have controller events assigned to them. Implementing this involves <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8510\">adding the control port triggers</a> to the Tor codebase, running Torperf and then collecting and analyzing the results.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h4>Hidden Services should reuse old Introduction Points</h4>\n<p>Currently, Hidden Services stop establishing circuits to old Introduction Points after they break. While this behavior makes sense, it means that clients who have old hidden service descriptors will keep introducing themselves to the wrong introduction points. This is especially painful in roaming situations where users frequently change networks (and lose existing circuits).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8239\">A solution to this</a> would be for Hidden Services to reestablish failed circuits to old Introduction Points (if the circuits were destroyed because of network failures). We should explore the security consequences of such a move, and also what's the exact time period that Introduction Points are considered \"old\" but still \"worth reestablishing circuits to\".</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Encrypted Services</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/ideas/xxx-encrypted-services.txt\">Encrypted Services</a> is the correct way of implementing the now-defunct <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ExitEnclave\">Exit Enclaves</a>.</p>\n<p>Encrypted Services allow you to run a non-anonymous Hidden Service where the server-side rendezvous circuit is only one hop. This makes sense in scenarios where the Hidden Service doesn't care about its anonymity, but still wants to allow its clients to access it anonymously (and with all the other features that self-authenticating names provide). See Roger's <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/ideas/xxx-encrypted-services.txt\">original proposal</a> for more use cases and information.</p>\n<p>On this topic, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2012-March/003434.html\">Robert Ransom proposed</a> to implement Encrypted Services as a program separate from Tor, since it serves a quite different threat model. Furthermore, if done this way, its users won't overload the Tor network and it will also allow greater versatility and easier deployment.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h3>Human Memorable onion addresses</h3>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle\">Zooko's triangle</a> characterizes onion addresses as <em>secure</em> and <em>global</em>, but not <em>human memorable</em>. By now <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/ideas/xxx-onion-nyms.txt\">a couple</a> <a href=\"http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Dec-2011/msg00034.html\">of schemes</a> have been proposed to make hidden services addresses memorable, but for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2012-March/003434.html\">various reasons</a> none of them has been particularly successful.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<hr>\n<br></p>\n<p>These were just some of the things that must be done in the Hidden Services realm. If you are interested in helping around, please read the links and trac tickets, and hit us back with <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/001-process.txt\">proposals</a>, patches and suggestions.

However, if we want Hidden Services to be truly successful and influential, it's also important to build a vibrant ecosystem around them. For example, we need privacy-preserving archiving systems and search engines (and technologies and rules on how they should work), we need easy-to-use publishing platforms, Internet service daemons and protocols optimized for high-latency connections, anonymous file sharing, chat systems and social networks.</p>\n<p>Thanks go to Roger, Robert and other people for the helpful comments and suggestions on this blog post.</p>\n<p>PS: Don't forget to use <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/\">anonbib</a> to find and download any research papers mentioned in this blog post.</p>"

I was one of the non-profits, representing <a href=\"https://wiki.tpo.is\">ipv tech</a>, Tor, and offering myself as a technical volunteer to help out other non-profits.

I'm helping the victims and advocates use the same technologies to empower the victims and turn the tables on the abusers in most cases. The ability to be anonymous and be free from surveillance for once, even for an hour, is cherished by the victims and affected advocates.</p>\n<p>Our team was great. Kevin, Paul, John, Bob, Carmine, Adam, and Sarah did a great job at keeping motivated, making progress, and joking along the way. Microsoft, Whole Foods, and a slew of sponsors offered endless food, sugary drinks, beautiful views, and encouragement throughout the weekend.</p>\n<p>Cambridge Community Television <a href=\"http://cctvcambridge.org/NEGiveCamp2013\">interviewed me</a> at the very end of the event. There's also a Flickr group <a href=\"https://secure.flickr.com/groups/negc2013/\">full of pictures</a>.</p>\n<p>Overall it was a great experience. I encourage you to volunteer next year.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Journalists and activists have been asking me this week about the news that the Obama administration is now <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/08/us/politics/obama-may-back-fbi-plan-to-wiretap-web-users.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">considering</a> whether to support the latest version of the FBI's <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/foia/foia-records-problems-electronic-surveillance\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Going Dark\"</a> legislation. Here are some points to add to the discussion.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is far from law currently. Nobody's even published any proposed text. Right now the White House is considering whether to back it, and now is a great time to help them understand how dangerous it would be for America.</li>\n<li>Forcing backdoors in communication tools is a mandate for insecurity. Haven't they been paying attention to just how much these same systems are under <a href=\"http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/ensuring-your-information-is-safe.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">attack</a> from foreign governments and criminals? Did they not learn any lessons from the wiretapping scandals in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_wiretapping_case_2004%E2%80%932005\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greece</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SISMI-Telecom_scandal\" rel=\"nofollow\">Italy</a>, where CALEA backdoors were used to surveil politicians, without law enforcement even knowing about it? You cannot add a backdoor to a communications system without making it more vulnerable to attack, both from insiders and from the outside.</li>\n<li>The Justice Department is being really short-sighted here by imagining that the world is black and white. We've heard from people at the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/trip-report-october-fbi-conference\" rel=\"nofollow\">FBI</a>, DEA, NSA, etc who <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en#lawenforcement\" rel=\"nofollow\">use Tor for their job</a>. If we changed the design so we could snoop on people, those users should go use a system that isn't broken by design &mdash; such as one in another country. And if those users should, why wouldn't criminals switch too?</li>\n<li>In any case, it seems likely that the law won't apply to The Tor Project, since we don't run the Tor network and also it's not a service. (We write free open source software, and then people run it to form a network.)</li>\n<li>The current <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_for_Law_Enforcement_Act\" rel=\"nofollow\">CALEA</a> already has an ugly <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/trip-report-german-foreign-office\" rel=\"nofollow\">trickle-down effect</a> on the citizens of other countries. Different governments have different standards for lawful access, but the technology doesn't distinguish. So when the Egyptian general plugs in his telco box and sees the connector labelled \"lawful access\", he thinks to himself \"I *am* the law\" and proceeds with surveilling his citizens to stay in power. To put it bluntly, America's lawful intercept program undermines its foreign policy goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And lastly, we should all keep in mind that they can't force us to do anything. You always have the alternative of stopping whatever it is you're doing. So for example if they try to \"force\" an individual <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#KeyManagement\" rel=\"nofollow\">directory authority</a> operator to do something, the operator should just stop operating the authority (and then consider working with EFF and ACLU to establish precedent that such an attempt was illegal). And so on, all the way up the chain. Good thing the Internet is an international community.</p>"

    "content": "<p>By now, just about everybody has heard about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29\">PRISM surveillance program</a>, and many are beginning to speculate on its impact on Tor.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there still are a lot of gaps to fill in terms of understanding what is really going on, especially in the face of conflicting information between the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/politics/prism-collection-documents/\">primary source material</a> and Google, Facebook, and Apple's claims of non-involvement.</p>\n<p>This apparent conflict means that it is still hard to pin down exactly how the program impacts Tor, and is leading many to assume worst-case scenarios.</p>\n<p>For example, some of the worst-case scenarios include the NSA using <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/10/us-usa-cyberweapons-specialreport-idUSBRE9490EL20130510\">weaponized exploits</a> to compromise datacenter equipment at these firms. Less severe, but still extremely worrying possibilities include issuing gag orders to mid or low-level datacenter staff to install backdoors or monitoring equipment without any interaction what-so-ever with the legal and executive staff of the firms themselves.</p>\n<p>We're going to save analysis of those speculative and invasive scenarios for when more information becomes available (though we may independently write a future blog post on <a href=\"http://www.thebulletin.org/web-edition/op-eds/cyberweapons-bold-steps-digital-darkness\">the dangers</a> of the government use of weaponized exploits).</p>\n<p>For now, let's review what Tor can do, what tools go well with Tor to give you defense-in-depth for your communications, and what work needs to be done so we can make it easier to protect communications from instances where the existing centralized communications infrastructure is compromised by the NSA, China, Iran, or by anyone else who manages to get ahold of the keys to the kingdom.</p>\n<p><br>The core Tor software's job is to conceal your identity from your recipient, and to conceal your recipient and your content from observers on your end. By itself, Tor does not protect the actual communications content once it leaves the Tor network. This can make it useful against some forms of metadata analysis, but this also means Tor is best used in combination with other tools.</p>\n<p>Through the use of <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\">HTTPS-Everywhere</a> in <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html\">Tor Browser</a>, in many cases we can protect your communications content where parts of the Tor network and/or your recipients' infrastructure are compromised or under surveillance. The EFF has created an <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https\">excellent interactive graphic</a> to help illustrate and clarify these combined properties. </p>\n<p>Through the use of combinations of additional software like <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/thunderbird/addon/torbirdy/\">TorBirdy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.enigmail.net/home/index.php\">Enigmail</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging#Client_support\">OTR</a>, and <a href=\"https://joindiaspora.com/\">Diaspora</a>, Tor can also protect your communications content in cases where the communications infrastructure (Google/Facebook) is compromised.</p>\n<p><br>However, the real interesting use cases for Tor in the face of dragnet surveillance like this is not that Tor can protect your gmail/facebook accounts from analysis (in fact, Tor could never really protect account usage metadata), but that Tor and hidden services are actually a key building block to build systems where it is no longer possible to go to a single party and obtain the full metadata, communications frequency, *or* contents.</p>\n<p>Tor hidden services are arbitrary communications endpoints that are resistant to both metadata analysis and surveillance.</p>\n<p>A simple (to deploy) example of a hidden service based mechanism to significantly hinder exactly this type of surveillance is an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmpp\">XMPP</a> client that also ships with an XMPP server and a Tor hidden service. Such a P2P communication system (where the clients are themselves the servers) is both end-to-end secure, and does *not* have a single central server where metadata is available. This communication is private, pseudonymous, and does not have involve any single central party or intermediary.</p>\n<p>More complex examples would include the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora_%28software%29\">Diaspora</a> and other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_software_and_protocols_for_distributed_social_networking\">decentralized social network protocols</a> with hidden service endpoints.</p>\n<p><br>Despite these compelling use cases and powerful tool combination possibilities, the Tor Project is under no illusion that these more sophisticated configurations are easy, usable, or accessible by the general public.</p>\n<p>We recognize that a lot of work needs to be done even for the basic tools like Tor Browser, TorBirdy, EnigMail, and OTR to work seamlessly and securely for most users, let alone complex combinations like XMPP or Diaspora with Hidden Services.</p>\n<p>Additionally, hidden services themselves are in need of <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love\">quite a bit of development assistance</a> just to maintain their originally designed level of security, let alone scaling to support large numbers of endpoints.</p>\n<p>Being an Open Source project with limited resources, we welcome contributions from the community to make any of this software work better with Tor, or to help improve the Tor software itself.</p>\n<p>If you're not a developer, but you would still like to help us succeed in our mission of securing the world's communications, <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate.html.en\">please donate!</a> It is a rather big job, after all.</p>\n<p><br>We will keep you updated as we learn more about the exact capabilities of this program.</p>"

    "content": "<p><b>Update 2013/6/28:</b> Describe workaround for the Windows d2d1.dll crash. </p>\n<p>After almost 6 months of solid development, the Tor Project is proud to announce the first alpha in the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/tbb-30\">3.0 series</a> of the Tor Browser Bundle!</p>\n<p>The 3.0alpha1 bundles are downloadable from the <a href=\"https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/3.0a1/\">Tor Package Archive</a>.</p>\n<h1>Release Highlights</h1>\n<p>Here are the major highlights of the 3.0 series:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Usability, usability, usability!</b>\n<p>We've attempted to solve several major usability issues in this series, including:</p>\n<ol type=\"A\">\n<li><b>No more Vidalia</b>\n<p>The Tor process management is handled by the new Tor Launcher Firefox extension. If you want the Vidalia map and other features, you can point an existing Vidalia binary at control port 9151 after Tor Browser has launched, and it should still work (and even allow you to reconfigure the TBB Tor as a bridge or a relay).\n     </li>\n<li><b>Local homepage with search box</b>\n<p>\nThe browser now uses a local about:tor homepage instead of <a href=\"https://check.torproject.org\" title=\"https://check.torproject.org\">https://check.torproject.org</a>. A local verification against the Tor control port is still performed, to ensure Tor is working, and a link to <a href=\"https://check.torproject.org\" title=\"https://check.torproject.org\">https://check.torproject.org</a> is provided from the about:tor homepage for manual verification as well.\n     </li>\n<li><b>Guided Extraction for Windows</b>\n<p>\nFor Windows users, an NSIS-based extractor now guides you through the TBB extraction and ensures the extracted bundle ends up on your Desktop, or in a known location chosen by you (but make sure you have permissions on that location). Hopefully this will mean no more losing track of the extracted bundle files!\n      </p>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><b>Email-sized bundles</b>\n<p>The bundles are all under the 25M gmail attachment size limit, so direct email and gettor attachments are once again possible.</li>\n<li><b>Improved build security and integrity verification</b><br />\nWe now use <a href=\"https://gitian.org/\">Gitian</a> to build the bundles. The idea behind Gitian is to allow independent people to take our source code and produce exactly identical binaries on their own. We're not quite at the point where you always get a matching build, but the remaining differences are minor, and within a couple more releases we should have it fully reproducible. For now, we are <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/tbb-3.0alpha1-builds/\">posting all of the builds</a> for  comparison, and you can of course <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/README.build\">build and compare your own</a>.\n</ol>\n<h1>Known issues</h1>\n<p>Of course, being an alpha release (in fact, the first alpha release of this series), we expect these bundles to have some issues. Here's the major user-facing issues that we know about so far:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Crash Issue: Windows Permissions</b>\n<p>On Windows, if you install the bundle to anywhere other than the Desktop, permissions issues can cause the bundles to crash at startup.</li>\n<li><b>Crash Issue: Windows Software Conflict(s)</b>\n<p>There appears to be an issue with direct2d rendering acceleration that affects  some video cards, and has a crash report with a module d2d1.dll. The simplest workaround is to right click on 'Start Tor Browser' and select \"Properties->Compatibility->Run in Windows XP Compatibility mode\".</li>\n<li><b>Extraction: Delete or rename your old TBB directory first!</b>\n<p>These bundles are significantly different than the previous alphas or stable releases. You must not extract this bundle on top of a previous TBB directory, or multiple things will break. If you want to preserve your bookmarks and history, you can do so by copying only the <b>places.sqlite</b> file from your old bundle directory into the new one. The good news is that the elimination of Vidalia should make it much simpler for us to finally deploy an autoupdater, but please bear with us until we can finally complete that important usability work.\n </li>\n<li><b>Misc: Missing Translations</b>\n<p>Some of the translations strings for the Tor Launcher startup got munged by Transifex. In particular, the Farsi and the German builds both have missing button labels and strings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you experience any other issues, please let us know and/or <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/newticket\">file a bug!</a></p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the very first issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter meant to cover what is happening in the vibrant Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Deterministic, independently reproduced builds of Tor Browser Bundle</h1>\n<p>Mike Perry, Linus Nordberg and Georg Koppen each independently built identical binaries of the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30alpha2-released\">Tor Browser Bundle 3.0 alpha 2 release</a>, now <a href=\"https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/3.0a2/\">available for download at the Tor Package Archive</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/README.build\">build system</a>, first adopted for the release of 3.0 alpha 1, uses <a href=\"http://gitian.org/\">Gitian</a> to enable anyone to produce byte-identical Tor Browser Bundle binary packages from source. This represents a major improvement in the security of the Tor software build and distribution processes against targeted attacks.  The motivations and technical details of this work will appear in future Tor Project blog posts.</p>\n<h1>Minor progress on datagram-based transport</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/moving-tor-datagram-transport\">As Steven Murdoch explained in 2011</a>, in the current implementation of Tor, “when a packet gets dropped or corrupted on a link between two Tor nodes, […], all circuits passing through this pair of nodes will be stalled, not only the circuit corresponding to the packet which was dropped.” This is because traffic from multiple circuits heading into an OR node are multiplexed by default into a single TCP connection. However, when the reliability and congestion control requirements of TCP streams are enforced (by the operating system) on this multiplexed connection, a situation is created in which one poor quality circuit can disproportionately slow down the others.</p>\n<p>This shortcoming could be worked around by migrating Tor from TCP to a datagram-based transport protocol. Nick Mathewson opened <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9165\">#9165</a> to track progress on the matter.</p>\n<p>Late last year, Steven Murdoch began an <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/sjm217/tor.git/shortlog/refs/heads/utp\">experimental Tor branch using uTP</a>, a protocol “which provides reliable, ordered delivery while maintaining minimum extra delay”, and is already <a href=\"http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0029.html\">used by uTorrent for peer-to-peer connections</a>. Nick Mathewson finally got to review his work and wrote several comments on <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9166\">#9166</a>. The code isn’t close to production-quality right now; it is just good enough for performance testing.</p>\n<h1>obfsproxyssh</h1>\n<p>Yawning Angel sent out <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/005083.html\">a request for comments</a> on the very first release of <a href=\"https://github.com/Yawning/obfsproxyssh\">obfsproxyssh</a>, a pluggable transport that uses the ssh wire protocol to hide Tor traffic. Its behavior would appear to potential eavesdroppers to be “identical to a user sshing to a host, authenticating with a RSA public/private key pair and opening a direct-tcp channel to the ORPort of the bridge.”</p>\n<p>The announcement contains several open issues and questions. Feel free to have a look and voice your comments!</p>\n<h1>Crowdfunding for Tor exit relays and bridges</h1>\n<p>Moritz Bartl announced that he has started a <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tor-anti-censorship-and-anonymity-infrastructure/\">crowdfunding campaign for Tor exit relays and bridges</a>.</p>\n<p>The donations will be distributed equally among all Torservers.net partner organizations (Zwiebelfreunde e.V., DFRI, Nos Oignons, Swiss Privacy Foundation, Frënn vun der Ënn and NoiseTor).</p>\n<p>For a faster and better network, chip in and spread the word!</p>\n<h1>Tails 0.19 is out, new stable Tor Browser Bundles</h1>\n<p>On Wednesday, June 26, two of the most popular Tor projects both made new releases: the Tor Browser Bundle, and Tails, The Amnesiac Incognito Live System.

The report is a detailed write-up of the forensic experiments Sandvik has been <a href=\"http://encrypted.cc/post/51552592311/forensic-analysis-of-tor-on-os-x\">documenting on her blog</a>, the goal of which was “to identify traces left behind by the Tor Browser Bundle after extracting, using, and deleting the bundle”.</p>\n<p>In short, each platform indeed retains forensic traces of the existence of the Tor Browser Bundle. Many “are related to default operating system settings, some of which the bundle might not be able to remove. We therefore <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/7033\">propose the creation of a document</a> which lists steps our users can take to mitigate these traces on the different operating systems.”</p>\n<p>Of course, Tor Browser Bundle users wishing to take immediate action to prevent the creation of forensic traces are not out of luck: “the easiest way to avoid leaving traces on a computer system is to use <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/\">The Amnesiac Incognito Live System (Tails)</a>.”</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous development news</h1>\n<p>David Goulet is <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/005069.html\">making good progress</a> on his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/004959.html\">rewrite of torsocks</a> and should have a beta ready in a couple of weeks.

After a lengthy Twitter debate with Mathewson, the reporter disappeared, no bugs have been filed, and it appears the vulnerability was nothing of the sort.  Without being able to verify the existence of the claimed vulnerability, Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-June/028701.html\">concluded</a> that the reporter’s described attack was equivalent “at worst… to the ‘request filtering’ attack… which has defenses”.</p>\n<p>The issue was also <a href=\"http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2013/Jun/245\">mentioned</a> (and likewise dismissed) on the security mailing list, Full Disclosure.</p>\n<p>For anyone interested in reporting vulnerabilities in Tor software, please avoid following that example.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the second issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter meant to cover what is happening in the great Tor community.</p>\n<h1>First release candidate for Tor 0.2.4.x series</h1>\n<p>On July 3rd, Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028776.html\">announced the release of Tor 0.2.4.15-rc</a>. As “rc” suggests, it is the first release candidate for the 0.2.4.x series. This version fixes a few smaller bugs over the latest alpha, but “generally appears stable,” Roger noted.</p>\n<p>Some highlights of <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/b13c6becc:/ChangeLog\">changes from 0.2.3.x</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>bridges now report the pluggable transports they support to the bridge authority (<a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/3589\">#3589</a>),\n<li>\n<li>IPv6 support (<a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/5534\">#5534</a>, <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/5535\">#5535</a>, <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/6362\">#6362</a>, <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/6363\">#6363</a>),</li>\n<li>automatically forward the TCP ports of pluggable transport proxies using tor-fw-helper if PortForwarding is enabled (<a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/6522\">#6522</a>),</li>\n<li>switch to a nonrecursive Makefile structure. Where available, now use automake’s “silent” make rules by default (<a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/4567\">#4567</a>),</li>\n<li>many, many more small improvements and fixes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">download it and test widely and wildly</a>.</p>\n<h1>New vulnerability in Tor Browser Bundle 2.3.25-10?</h1>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9195\">anonymous reporter reported</a> a potential leak when using the Tor Browser Bundle on Windows. If Microsoft Security Essentials or another cloud based anti-virus solution is configured, downloads will automatically be sent to these external providers — bypassing Tor — once complete.</p>\n<p>The reporter suggested setting the <code>browser.download.manager.scanWhenDone</code> property to <code>false</code> to prevent anti-virus solutions from starting without user interaction.</p>\n<h1>The Tor Project is hiring a Lead Automation Engineer</h1>\n<p>Do you have experience programming in multiple languages, including Java, Python/Ruby, shell scripting, and JavaScript?</p>\n<p>The Tor Project <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005119.html\">opened a new position</a> as Lead Automation Engineer. The project seeks to deploy nightly builds and continuous integration for as many of its key software components and platform combinations as possible. Mike Perry wrote, “Candidates are expected to be capable of taking the lead in selecting, deploying, and maintaining multiple automation systems in several different programming languages.”</p>\n<p>For more details, including information on how to apply, see <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-lead-automation.html.en\">the job posting</a>.</p>\n<h1>check.torproject.org outage</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-check-outage-03-and-04-july-2013\">As Andrew Lewman wrote on Thursday, July 4th</a>, “over the past 24 hours <code>https://check.torproject.org</code> has been unavailable due to excessive DNS queries to the exitlist service. It seems there are a number of individuals and companies with commercial products relying upon this volunteer service. We finally hit the point where we couldn’t keep up with the queries and simply disabled the service”.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, the service is again available, but the project might “take it down as needed without notice.”</p>\n<p>‘check.torproject.org’ is no longer the homepage for Tails since <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.16/\">January of this year</a>. The Tor Browser Bundle will also <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/7494\">switch to a new homepage in version 3</a>, currently in alpha stage.</p>\n<p>Other software or services that depend on check.torproject.org should either migrate away or run their own version using <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/Tor/check/trunk/\">the source code for the web page</a>. It is supported by a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorDNSExitList\">database of running exit nodes that can be queried through DNS</a>.</p>\n<p>If you wish to help, one need is to make it easier for third parties to get their own “check” service running. This means <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9204\">getting the service more modular</a> and improving <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tordnsel.git\">TorDNSEL</a> or finishing <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbel.git\">TorBEL</a>. Someone must also write documentation that is easy to follow.</p>\n<h1>An experimental transparent Tor proxy for Windows</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028809.html\">basil announced a new experimental transparent Tor proxy for using Tor on Windows</a>: “1) It (transparently) reroutes all HTTP traffic through the Tor anonymity network; and 2) It blocks all non-Tor traffic (including DNS) to and from your computer.”</p>\n<p>The project is currently dubbed TorWall but the name is likely to change as it is problematic regarding the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq\">Tor trademark</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028833.html\">Roger pointed out</a> that there is already a discontinued project called Torwall. Roger also pointed out that transparent proxying might not be the best solutions “on the theory that if the given application isn’t specifically configured to use Tor, it’s probably going to screw up privacy-wise.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028840.html\">basil answered</a> by stating that the project was “really for those who know and understand the risks (possibly a very limited market?).” Feel free to give it a try if you do!</p>\n<h1>Theft of Tor relay private keys?</h1>\n<p>On Tuesday, July 2nd, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028749.html\">Thomas H. expressed concern</a> about a hypothetical attacker breaking into a large number of nodes and stealing their private keys, combined with gathering all the traffic possible. “Wouldn’t this increase the likelihood that data from complete circuits can be decrypted and traced back to the original sender?”</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028751.html\">response to this question</a>, Mike Perry admits that he shares Thomas’ concerns: “If their intercepts are passive, merely stealing relays’ private identity key won’t accomplish much because Tor uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_forward_secrecy\">Forward Secrecy</a> for both the relay TLS links and for circuit setup.  However, if their intercepts are active (as in they can arbitrarily manipulate traffic in-flight), then stealing either Guard node keys or directory authority keys allows complete route capture and traffic discovery of targeted clients”.</p>\n<p>To avoid this danger, Mike Perry has previously suggested “changes to Tor to make such key theft easier to detect, less damaging, and harder to make use of” (see <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/7126\">#7126</a>, <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/5968\">#5968</a>).</p>\n<p>Mike also supports the idea of <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/5563\">regular identity key rotation for relays</a>. He would like to see support for default key rotation in the future.</p>\n<p>Mike pointed out that currently changing an identity key too frequently has several disadvantages for the Tor network: “First, it takes the bandwidth measurement servers a couple days to ramp up your capacity of your new identity key, so you will spend a lot of time below your max throughput. Second, you would also likely never get the Guard flag. Third, there are also load balancing issues with Guard nodes where as soon as you get the Guard flag, it will take 1-2 months before clients switch to your new Guard, so you will also likely spend that time at less than your full capacity.”</p>\n<p>If you are operating a relay, please check the wiki page with <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorRelaySecurity\">tips for enhancing the relay’s security</a>.</p>\n<h1>A new interface to explore the Tor network</h1>\n<p>On June 25th, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/005063.html\">Christian (makepanic) announced</a> a new web application to explore the Tor network. Based on the <a href=\"http://emberjs.com/\">Ember.js framework</a>, it uses data from <a href=\"https://onionoo.torproject.org/\">Onionoo</a> to display information about Tor relays and bridges.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005122.html\">Karsten pointed out</a>, this tool already has the same set of features as <a href=\"https://atlas.torproject.org/\">Atlas</a> — the current recommended way to get details about relays — and even a few more: it can “list 10 fastest relays on start page” and “show bridge details”. As Onionoo was designed exactly to offer a backend for various visualization tools, Karsten thinks “it’s fine to have more than one website providing access to Onionoo data. Yay, diversity.”</p>\n<p>Feel free to play with <a href=\"http://makepanic.github.io/emberjs-tor-onionoo/\">Tor Onionoo search</a> or have a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/makepanic/emberjs-tor-onionoo\">its source code</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous development news</h1>\n<p>Karsten Loesing has <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/commit/2a61b0dd6be\">updated GeoIP databases for Tor and Onionoo to July MaxMind databases</a> without their A1 Anonymous Proxy ranges. See <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/6266\">#6266</a> for more details on why and how we need to fix the data released by MaxMind.</p>\n<p>It looks like the ‘start-tor-browser’ shell script cannot be used to start the Tor Browser from the graphical file manager on Ubuntu 13.04. If you have any great ideas, <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9091\">please chime in</a>.</p>\n<p>If you can write C code, you could make the lives of many relay operators easier by making tor configuration accept “bit/s” on top of the current “byte/s” [43]. The former, being more commonly used by network operators to describe bandwidth, could reduce a common case of confusion. It looks like <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9214\">a patch would be pretty simple</a>!</p>\n<p>Work has started on a pluggable transport that would <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/7167\">combine the traffic obfuscation properties of obfsproxy with the address diversity of Flashproxy</a>.</p>\n<p>intrigeri has <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-July/003240.html\">announced two “low-hanging fruits” sessions for Tails</a>. Feel free to join the #tails IRC channel on July 11th at 8:00 UTC or on July 13, 2013, at 7:00 UTC. “Everyone interested in contributing to Tails is warmly welcome to join! The idea is to spend a while together on many small tasks that take less than 2 hours each, and are waiting in our TODO list for too long.” He also gave a list of candidate tasks.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2013-July/000157.html\">Erinn Clark pointed out</a>, the 3.x branch of Tor Browser is currently missing a map of relays similar to the one shown in Vidalia.  The latter can be kept as a separate application, but this specific bit of functionality might simply be implementable using web technologies. Care to give it a try?</p>\n<h1>More monthly status reports for June 2013</h1>\n<p>Continuing from last week, more monthly reports are now available for June 2013: <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000280.html\">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000284.html\">Aaron G.</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000285.html\">Runa A.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the third issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter meant to cover what is happening in the amazing Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Last call for testing Tor 0.2.4 branch</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028934.html\">Roger Dingledine notified tor-talk</a> that there are <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#Download-torbrowserbundlealpha\">new versions of the Tor Browser Bundle</a>, dubbed 2.4.15-beta-1, that are ready to be tested: “If all goes well, we‘ll be calling the Tor 0.2.4 branch stable very soon. So now is the perfect time to let us know that it broke for you.”</p>\n<p>He also added “to be clear, it is the Tor part of the Tor Browser Bundle that needs testing. We know there are a growing pile of bugs in Vidalia, as well as a set of issues in Torbutton. Both of these should improve with the TBB 3.0 release. But that is a separate thread.”</p>\n<h1>Tor Hack Day, Munich, Germany</h1>\n<p>Meet the people who spend their day making Tor a reality. Join them for a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/join-us-tor-hack-day-munich-germany\">public hack day</a> on Friday, July 26, 2013 in Munich, Germany at the <a href=\"http://www.tum.de/\">Technische Universität München</a>.</p>\n<p>The agenda and conversations will be determined by you and Tor‘s team of developers and researchers — so bring your ideas, questions, projects, and technical expertise with you!</p>\n<h1>13<sup>th</sup> Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium</h1>\n<p>Many academic researchers and students interested in anonymity are already working with Tor. They also are part of a broader community of academics that gather every year during the <a href=\"http://petsymposium.org/\">Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium</a>. <a href=\"http://petsymposium.org/2013/program.php\">The 13<sup>th</sup> edition</a> was held in Bloomington, Indiana, USA and was again well attended.</p>\n<p>Several Tor developers were among the crowd of around 130 attendees (this makes it a new record or very close). On the first day, the first workshop on <a href=\"http://petools.soic.indiana.edu/\">Privacy Enhancing Tools (PETools)</a> was held, in which Roger Dingledine was invited to talk about “Lessons from Tor: How to Help Developers and Researchers Improve your Privacy Tool.”</p>\n<p>During the next two days, researchers presented the selected papers. Two of them are directly relevant to the development of the Tor network:</p>\n<p>Mashael Alsabah, Kevin Bauer, Tariq Elahi, and Ian Goldberg presented <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/pets2013/paper_65.pdf\">Conflux</a>, “a dynamic traffic-splitting approach that assigns traffic to an overlay path based on its measured latency. […] Conflux considerably increases performance for clients using low-bandwidth bridges.” <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028950.html\">A thread on tor-talk</a> discusses effects of Conflux on website fingerprinting.</p>\n<p>John Geddes, Rob Jansen, and Nicholas Hopper studied <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/pets2013/paper_80.pdf\">balancing performance with anonymity in Tor</a>. They have “investigated the effects of proposed [performance enhancing] modifications on attacks that rely on network measurements as a side channel.” The paper concluded with “an analysis of the total reduction in anonymity that clients face due to<br />\neach proposed mechanism.”</p>\n<p>Other papers are relevant to the wider set of Tor problems:</p>\n<p>David Fifield, Gabi Nakibly, and Dan Boneh have looked at <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/pets2013/paper_29.pdf\">web-based online scanning service […] that can be covertly used as proxies in a censorship circumvention system</a> The system they describe is already “available as an experimental rendezvous for the <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/\">flash proxy system</a> and is part of <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html#download\">Tor’s pluggable-transports web browser bundles</a> starting with the 2.4.11-alpha-1 release.”</p>\n<p>Amir Houmansadr and Nikita Borisov presented an analysis of how practical it is to <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/pets2013/paper_71.pdf\">reliably fingerprint millions of network flows by tagging only as few as tens of packets from each flow</a>.</p>\n<p>An extra day was dedicated to the HotPETs workshop, intended to “foster new ideas, spirited debates, and controversial perspectives on privacy (and lack thereof).” Among other interesting submissions, Wenxuan Zhou, Amir Houmansadr, Matthew Caesar, and Nikita Borisov presented <a href=\"http://petsymposium.org/2013/papers/zhou-censorship.pdf\">SWEET</a>, a way to encapsulate “a censored user’s traffic inside email messages that are carried over by typical email service providers.”</p>\n<p>All papers presented during the conference are available for download from the program page.</p>\n<p>The next edition of PETS will be help July 16-18, 2014, in Amsterdam.</p>\n<h1>Hardware for high bandwidth relay</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-July/002239.html\">Andreas Fink asked for hints on hardware</a> that could support “big fat tor exit nodes connected with multiple 1gbps or 10gps links.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-July/002241.html\">Andy Isaacson answered</a> that <a href=\"http://noisetor.net/\">Noisetor</a> uses “most of a 4-core X3350 2.6 GHz to push ~500 Mbps symmetric. That‘s without AES-NI.” Mike Perry and Moritz Bartl then both confirmed that modern Intel Xeon CPUs with AES-NI could do 300 Mbit/s per core.</p>\n<h1>Blocking GFW probes on the firewall</h1>\n<p>Marek Majkowski suggests how to resist <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/pdf/foci2012.pdf\">Chinese effort to scan Tor relays and bridges</a> using a firewall. Somewhere in the past month the Great Firewall of China started to actively probe the destination of any traffic that looked like a Tor bridge, plain or obfs2. If a handshake is successful, the connection is reset and the bridge address put on a blacklist.</p>\n<p>As the probe sequence is static, Marek identified the incoming connection and gave <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028897.html\">rules for the netfilter Linux firewall to filter them out</a>.</p>\n<p>If you run a bridge under Linux, please give them a try!</p>\n<h1>Is it worth running a relay on a home broadband connection?</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-July/002240.html\">Nick asked on the tor-relays mailing-list</a>: “I have a reasonable ADSL connection, and a little always-on server.  The bandwidth is in the region of 2Mib/s down, something less up (maybe 256Kib/s). Is it useful for me to run a tor relay with this bandwidth?”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-July/002249.html\">Lunar pointed out</a> that a relay with this capacity was “likely to be selected as a middle node 1 time out of 10000 circuits, if not less…”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-July/002255.html\">Roger Dingledine drew the cut</a>: “at this point if you‘re at least 800kbit (100KBytes/s) each way, it‘s useful to be a relay.” He also detailed the current thresholds for the Stable and Guard flags.</p>\n<p>Roger mentioned connections can still be of use though: ”a bridge is a fine thing to run on a connection with 250KBytes down and 32KBytes up.” And maybe even more in the future as “we might end up with a system like <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/pets2013/paper_65.pdf\">Conflux</a> to let you glue together two slow bridges and get better throughput.”</p>\n<h1>Using Mumble with Tor</h1>\n<p>David H. wrote a <a href=\"http://huertanix.tumblr.com/post/55261352264/location-anonymous-voice-communication-a-step-by-step\">tutorial on how to configure Mumble to use the Tor network on Ubuntu</a>. This tutorial includes setting up a server using Amazon EC2. During the discussion, adrelanos came up with his own <a href=\"https://whonix.org/wiki/Voip\">tutorial on anonymous VoIP which focuses on installing Mumble on Whonix</a> behind an hidden service.</p>\n<p>Feel free to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028939.html\">follow the discussion on tor-talk</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous development news</h1>\n<p>OONI has published a <a href=\"https://ooni.torproject.org/zambia-a-country-under-deep-packet-inspection.html\">detailed report</a> on how Zambia is currently censoring the grass roots online newspaper <a href=\"https://zambianwatchdog.com/\">Zambian Watchdog</a>.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson merged a way to mock C functions in tor unit tests. The “mocking methodology” has been <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8949#comment:1\">described</a> as “the simplest thing that could work — it‘s one of the ones that festoon the code with macro salad, and uglifies the declarations of functions that are going to get mocked. It has the advantage of being portable, robust, and comprehensible.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005129.html\">Runa A. Sandvik announced</a> that she has disabled translations for Vidalia on Transifex as “translators should not work on resources which are currently not being maintained by a developer.”</p>\n<p>Three GSoC students have sent updates: Johannes Fürmann on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005140.html\">EvilGenius censorship simulation project</a>, Robert on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005141.html\">Tor path generation and Stream-RTT probing</a>, and Hareesan on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005143.html\">steganography browser addon</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, luttigdev, dope457, whabib, Karsten Loesing, and Roger Dingledine.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the 4<sup>th</sup> issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the great Tor community.</p>\n<p>The next newsletter is going to be posted to the resurrected <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">tor-news mailing-list</a>. Just subscribe!</p>\n<h1>Summer Development Meeting 2013</h1>\n<p>About 40 core Tor contributors gathered over July 22-23 at the <a href=\"http://www.tum.de/\">Technische Universität München</a> in Germany for <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting\">this year's Summer Development Meeting</a>. That's quite a number, and as could be expected, there are a huge number of topics up for discussion — the brainstorming session generated around 150. Gunner from <a href=\"http://aspirationtech.org/\">Aspiration Tech</a> is once again facilitating the meeting, helping everyone focus on the most pressing issues.</p>\n<p>Rough notes from some of the break-out sessions are now up on the wiki. A list of the topics and a brief summary of the discussions are given below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/LoveForVolunteers\">Love for volunteers</a>: strategies for outreach and long-term support; identifying where they're most needed</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/PluggableTransports0\">Censorship and pluggable transports</a>: documenting the now-large number of pluggable transports; discussing countries' differing censorship strategies</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/Fundraising\">Fundraising</a>: funding outlook seems to be positive, although diversity in funding sources is needed to reduce dependency on single institutions like the US Government</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/WebsiteTranslation\">Website Translation</a>: notes from a discussion which led to the definition of a new translation review process and a list of actionables</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/ServiceInfrastructure\">Service infrastructure</a>: multiple fundamental services could use some more love: GetTor (TBB by email), website, Trac, check.tp.org, BridgeDB; shutting down unmaintained services</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/OpSec\">Operational security</a>: random notes on OpSec for Tor people</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the sidelines of the dev meeting, Roger and Jake are doing a public talk on the topic of <a href=\"https://gnunet.org/tor2013tum\">Tor and the Censorship Arms Race</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to meet people who spend their day making Tor a reality, you can <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/join-us-tor-hack-day-munich-germany\">join them for a public hack day</a> on Friday, July 26, 2013. Bring your ideas, questions, projects, and technical expertise with you!</p>\n<h1>Remote descriptor fetching in Stem</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005156.html\">Damian Johnson announced</a> having implemented remote descriptor fetching in <a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/\">Stem</a>, a feature to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-May/004924.html\">migrate more metrics measurement tools to Python</a>. “Its usage is pleasantly simple” wrote Damian. See for yourself in the <a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/api/descriptor/remote.html\">excellent documentation</a>!</p>\n<h1>Orbot 12.0.1 call for beta testing</h1>\n<p>After a long interval, Nathan Freitas <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/029063.html\">announced the release of a new version of Orbot</a> — a client for the Tor network on Android mobile devices. For Orbot 12.0.1, the developers have “switched versioning styles to a simpler major.minor.bugfix model”, wrote Nathan.</p>\n<p>He continues with a call for testing: “Since we haven't done a release in a while, and we have some new build tools, I mostly want to make sure I have not done something terribly wrong in the build process. Please confirm back if you are able to successfully use this release.”</p>\n<p>Updates in 12.0.1:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updated to Tor 0.2.4.15-RC</li>\n<li>flashy screen bug fixed now shows traffic</li>\n<li>Stats in notification area</li>\n<li>better handling of preference settings</li>\n<li>Changes added superuser permission for Cyanogen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/releases/Orbot-release-12.0.1-beta-1.apk\">download and start testing this release</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous development news</h1>\n<p>Lunar reported on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000292.html\">trip to Brussels for LSM 2013</a>. To sum it up, “people are really supportive of what we do these days”.</p>\n<p>anonym outlined the <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-July/003292.html\">release schedule for Tails 0.20</a>.</p>\n<p>intrigeri announced that <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-July/003297.html\">Tails has switched to a more conventional task manager</a>. It might now be easier for you to see what needs to be done. Have a look at the current list of 496 <a href=\"https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues\">open issues</a>, there might be something waiting just for you.</p>\n<p>Tor developers would love to find an easier way to debug tor when the daemon crashes. Nick Mathewson came up with an initial piece of code that could (when complete) <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9299\">dump stack traces</a> on assertion, crash, or general trouble to the logs. There's more work to be done before it can be merged in Tor. Feel free to help — especially if you know how to do this on Windows or BSD.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson along with Andrea created a wiki page for <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/roadmaps/Tor/025/TicketTriage025\">initial 0.2.5 series ticket triage</a>. If you have your own agenda for 0.2.5, you should be talking to them now!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005158.html\">Kostas Jakeliunas reported on their GSoC project</a> about producing a searchable metrics archive.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-July/000291.html\">Arturo reported</a> on his activities on Ooni probe in June.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005161.html\">Pierre Lalet announced</a> that he started working on an implementation of the Tor protocol in Python. The intent is to have an independent implementation to test Tor. As the author puts it, \"the purpose is NOT to implement a secure or robust implementation that could be an alternative to Tor.\" Have a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/cea-sec/TorPylle\">the code</a>: \"Comments, fixes and questions welcome!\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, dope457, harmony, moskvax, malaparte, whabib, and David Fifield.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the 5<sup>th</sup> issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the busy Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Summer Developer Meeting Wrap-up</h1>\n<p>The 2013 summer Tor development meeting happened at the <a href=\"http://www.tum.de/\">Technische Universität München</a>. There were no formal talks during the meeting itself, but <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:050322-tumuenchen-parabeln.jpg\">slides were still involved</a>!</p>\n<p>New minutes from sessions to add to those covered in the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-weekly-news-%E2%80%94-july-24th-2013\">last edition</a> have been <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting\">posted to the wiki</a>. This includes a second discussion on <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/PluggableTransports1\">Pluggable Transports</a>, the role of the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/ResearchDirector\">Research Director</a>, a summary of discussions with cryptographers Tanja Lange and djb about the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/TorCrypto\">cryptographic aspects of Tor</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/Timesheets\">timesheets for Tor contractors</a> and <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/MailingLists\">mailing-lists</a>.</p>\n<p>Christian Grothoff organized a talk with Roger Dingledine and Jacob Appelbaum at the university. Their initial topic was the censorship arms race, but given the up-to-date knowledge of the students and other attendees, the talk got turned into a marathon 4-hour long Q&amp;A session! Thanks to Christian, the <a href=\"https://gnunet.org/tor2013tum-video\">video is available</a> from the GNUnet website.</p>\n<p>The following day was dedicated to more concrete hands-on discussions and coding. The public hackfest was well-attended, with more than 70 people focusing on everything to do with Tor. Some attendees had even traveled several hundred kilometers to be there! Discussions popped up everywhere, code was written and some newcomers were introduced to the many elements that make up the Tor project. Thanks to everyone who showed up!</p>\n<h1>Comparing handshake protocols for Tor: Ace vs ntor</h1>\n<p>In WPES ’12, Esfandiar Mohammadi and Aniket Kate <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2012-August/003901.html\">introduced</a> <a href=\"http://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/~mohammadi/paper/owake.pdf\">Ace, an alternative for Tor’s current handshake protocol ntor</a>.</p>\n<p>Ace was already <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-July/005163.html\">discussed on tor-dev at the end of 2012</a>, “but back then, no implementation for the double scalar multiplication operation (a * b + c * d) on Curve25519 was available. But recently, Robert Ransom implemented in his <a href=\"http://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/~mohammadi/ace/celator.tar.gz\">celator library</a> a highly efficient double scalar multiplication which is suitable for our handshake protocol Ace”, wrote Esfandiar.</p>\n<p>From the comparative benchmarks that Shivanker Goel implemented and ran, using Ace could improve speed and CPU load compared to the current ntor implementation. Esfandiar Mohammadi’s email on tor-talk contains the methodology, remarks and concrete numbers.</p>\n<p>The code for the <a href=\"http://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/~mohammadi/ace/ace-benchmarks.tar.gz\">benchmark is available online</a> along with a <a href=\"http://www.infsec.cs.uni-saarland.de/~mohammadi/ace/ace-handshake.txt\">Tor-style proposal or improving circuit-creation key exchange using Ace</a>.</p>\n<h1>New Globe web application to explore the Tor network</h1>\n<p>Christian made his <a href=\"http://globe.rndm.de/\">Globe web application available</a> at a new location. Globe is quite similar to <a href=\"https://atlas.torproject.org\">Atlas</a>, and in fact uses the same data, but it also allows searching for bridges and is slightly more user-friendly.</p>\n<p>Globe now uses dygraphs as a graphing engine which makes it even easier to select time intervals for its graphs. Feel free to try out Globe and give feedback on <a href=\"https://github.com/makepanic/globe/issues\">its bug tracker</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor at OHM2013 — Netherlands</h1>\n<p>Several members of the Tor community will be at OHM2013: Observe, Hack, Make: “A five day outdoor international camping festival for hackers, makers, and those with an inquisitive mind”, according to <a href=\"https://ohm2013.org/\">their website</a>.

    "content": "<p>Around midnight on August 4th we were notified by a few people that a large number of hidden service addresses have disappeared from the Tor Network. There are a variety of rumors about a hosting company for hidden services: that it is suddenly offline, has been breached, or attackers have placed a javascript exploit on their web site.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en\">Hidden service</a> is a server – often delivering web pages – that is reachable only through the Tor network. While most people know that the Tor network with its thousands of volunteer-run nodes provides anonymity for users who don´t want to be tracked and identified on the internet, the lesser-known hidden service feature of Tor provides anonymity also for the server operator.</p>\n<p>Anyone can run hidden services, and many do. We use them internally at The Tor Project to offer our developers anonymous access to services such as SSH, IRC, HTTP, and our bug tracker. Other organizations run hidden services to protect dissidents, activists, and protect the anonymity of users trying to find help for suicide prevention, domestic violence, and abuse-recovery. Whistleblowers and journalists use hidden services to exchange information in a secure and anonymous way and publish critical information in a way that is not easily traced back to them. The New Yorker's <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/strongbox/\">Strongbox</a> is one public example.</p>\n<p>Hidden service addresses, aka the dot onion domain, are cryptographically and automatically generated by the tor software. They look like this <a href=\"http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/\">http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/</a>, which is our torproject.org website as a hidden service.</p>\n<p>There is no central repository nor registry of addresses. The dot onion address is both the name and routing address for the services hosted at the dot onion. The Tor network uses the .onion-address to direct requests to the hidden server and route back the data from the hidden server to the anonymous user. The design of the Tor network ensures that the user can not know where the server is located and the server can not find out the IP-address of the user, except by intentional malicious means like hidden tracking code embedded in the web pages delivered by the server. Additionally, the design of the Tor network, which is run by thousands of volunteers, ensures that it is impossible to censor or block certain .onion-addresses.</p>\n<p>The person, or persons, who run Freedom Hosting are in no way affiliated or connected to The Tor Project, Inc., the organization coordinating the development of the Tor software and research. In the past, adversarial organizations have skipped trying to break Tor hidden services and instead attacked the software running at the server behind the dot onion address. Exploits for PHP, Apache, MySQL, and other software are far more common than exploits for Tor. The current news indicates that someone has exploited the software behind Freedom Hosting. From what is known so far, the breach was used to configure the server in a way that it injects some sort of javascript exploit in the web pages delivered to users. This exploit is used to load a malware payload to infect user's computers. The malware payload could be trying to exploit potential bugs in Firefox 17 ESR, on which our <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser\">Tor Browser</a> is based. We're investigating these bugs and will fix<br />\nthem if we can.</p>\n<p>As for now, one of multiple hidden service hosting companies appears to be down. There are lots of rumors and speculation as to what's happened. We're reading the same news and threads you are and don't have any insider information. We'll keep you updated as details become available.</p>\n<p><b>EDIT:</b> See our <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-old-tor-browser-bundles-vulnerable\">next blog post</a> for more details about the attack.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the 6<sup>th</sup> issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the resilient Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Large hidden services provider compromised, attacks older TBB versions</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting\">Andrew Lewman wrote</a>: “Around midnight on August 4th we were notified by a few people that a large number of hidden service addresses have disappeared from the Tor network.”</p>\n<p>It turned out that Freedom Hosting, a company specializing in hosting websites accessible through Tor hidden services, was compromised. As Andrew puts it, “From what is known so far, the breach was used to configure the server in a way that it injects some sort of JavaScript exploit in the web pages delivered to users. This exploit is used to load a malware payload to infect user’s computers.” Andrew also reiterated that “the person, or persons, who run Freedom Hosting are in no way affiliated or connected to The Tor Project, Inc., the organization coordinating the development of the Tor software and research”.</p>\n<p>The Tor Browser is currently based on Mozilla Firefox 17 ESR. With the <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2013/08/04/investigating-security-vulnerability-report/\">help of Mozilla</a> and <a href=\"http://tsyrklevich.net/tbb_payload.txt\">other researchers</a> it was understood that the exploit used a vulnerability in Firefox JavaScript engine to attack Windows users of the Tor Browser Bundle. This vulnerability was <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/2013/mfsa2013-53.html\">fixed in Firefox 17.0.7 ESR</a> and subsequently in versions 2.3.25-10 (<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-and-tor-02414-alpha-packages\">released June 26 2013</a>), 2.4.15-alpha-1 (<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-and-tor-02414-alpha-packages\">released June 26 2013</a>) 3.0alpha2 (<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30alpha2-released\">released June 30 2013</a>) and 2.4.15-beta-1 (<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02415-rc-packages-available\">released July 8 2013</a>).</p>\n<p>Users running updated versions, and those who have disabled JavaScript, are not affected by the exploit.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine issued a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2013-August/000089.html\">security advisory</a> with advice to mitigate future issues: “be sure you’re running a recent enough Tor Browser Bundle”, “be sure to keep up-to-date in the future”, “consider disabling JavaScript”, “consider switching to a “live system” approach like Tails”, “be aware that many other vectors remain for vulnerabilities in Firefox”. It is strongly advised to read the advisory in full.</p>\n<p>The versions of Firefox used in Pluggable Transport bundles are still vulnerable. Replacements have been built, with credit to David Fifield, but they are <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9391\">yet to be released</a>.</p>\n<p>The press is running many stories covering these events, several containing false information. A better example is <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/08/freedom-hosting/\">Kevin Poulsen’s article</a> published in Wired on August, 5th. It did however assert “the malware only targets Firefox 17 ESR, the version of Firefox that forms the basis of the Tor Browser Bundle”, in-fact most recent Tor Browser Bundle releases, with the exception of Pluggable Transports bundles, contained the patched version of Firefox ESR.</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for July 2013</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of July has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000294.html\">Philipp Winter</a> was first this time, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000295.html\">Arlo Breault</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000296.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000299.html\">Noel David Torress Taño</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000297.html\">Colin C.</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000298.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000300.html\">Karsten Loesing</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000301.html\">Damian Johnson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000302.html\">Mike Perry</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000303.html\">George Kadianakis</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000304.html\">Andrew Lewman</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Tails developers issued a <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/test_0.20-rc1/\">call for testing</a> of the first release candidate of the upcoming 0.20 [21].

Arian Sanusi replied that speed of light was actually the limiting factor for latency issues: “if relays were homogeneous distributed among the globe, two random relays will be 1/4 earth circumference apart on average. […] That’s 400ms from finite speed of light. Switches, routers and relays along the way will add to that.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-commits/2013-August/060173.html\">Michael Marz</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-commits/2013-August/060250.html\">Neo</a> for running new mirrors of the Tor website.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by dope457, malaparte, Lunar, harmony, and Yawning.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the seventh issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the fast-paced Tor community.</p>\n<h1>New Tor Browser Bundle releases</h1>\n<p>Mozilla released <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/17.0.8/releasenotes/\">Firefox version 17.0.8esr</a> on August 6th, fixing several release critical bugs. Three days later, the stable, beta and alpha versions of the Tor Browser Bundle were updated, along with Tails<br />\n(see below).</p>\n<p>The stable 2.3.25-11 and 2.4.15-beta-2 also updates HTTPS Everywhere, PDF.js, NoScript and libpng to their latest version. Both bundles had a localization issue which was fixed in the subsequently <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-02416-rc-packages-and-updated-stable-tor-browser-bundles\">released 2.3.25-12 and 2.4.16-beta-1</a>.</p>\n<p>Before updating your browser to the latest version, please pause and admire the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads\">enhanced download page</a>. Kudos to J.M. Todaro for the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2109#comment:7\">design and patches</a> and Andrew for the final integration.</p>\n<p>The pluggable transports bundles have also been <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/pluggable-transports-bundles-2415-beta-2-pt1-firefox-1708esr\">updated to 2.4.15-beta-2-pt1</a>. Like previously, they contains flash proxy and obfsproxy configured to run by default. Using flash proxy requires a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto\">few extra steps</a>, as before.</p>\n<p>For more experimental matters, the new 3.0 series has seen the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30alpha3-released\">release of alpha3</a>. On top of the previous updates, several other small improvements were made: in the new launcher and build system, in fingerprinting fixes and in a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9195\">possible anonymity threat for Windows users</a> coming from cloud anti-virus solutions. This is another opportunity to play with the new build system that should produce byte-to-byte identical results. Please <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/README\">have a try</a> and report any discrepancies with Mike Perry’s builds.</p>\n<h1>Tails 0.20 has been released</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.20/\">32nd release of Tails is out</a>. It fixes several security issues, and all users are <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.19/\">advised to upgrade</a>.</p>\n<p>Among other small bugfixes, minor improvements and translation updates, this release tightens the security around Pidgin — by removing support for protocols other than IRC and XMPP — and restricting access to the ptrace(2) system call for unprivileged users.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/download/\">Download</a>, burn, and <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/usb_upgrade/\">upgrade</a>!</p>\n<h1>New release candidate for the 0.2.4 tor branch</h1>\n<p>Roger Dingledine announced the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029344.html\">release of tor 0.2.4.16-rc</a>, the latest incarnation of the 0.2.4 series. This release include several major and minor bugfixes.</p>\n<p>The most important one is probably a crash that can be triggered remotely via badly formatted INTRODUCE1 cells. Roger advises: “Anybody running a hidden service on the experimental 0.2.4.x branch should upgrade”.</p>\n<p>Erinn Clark has updated the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-02416-rc-packages-and-updated-stable-tor-browser-bundles\">beta version of the Tor Browser Bundle</a> for a wider audience of testers.</p>\n<h1>About Tor Browser usability</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-weekly-news-%E2%80%94-august-7th-2013\">Last week events</a> sparked a good amount of discussions on Tor Browser usability. Several discussions on tor-talk and in other places revolved around the idea that “JavaScript should be disabled by default”. scarp wrote a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029266.html\">good summary</a> on why it is not so simple: “I understand that JavaScript was enabled globally in the Tor Browser Bundle for usability reasons as well as to prevent browser fingerprinting. […] If the torproject were to disable it by default, that would not ensure that users are protected in the future by similar methods. Sites can be written in a way that if you do not allow JavaScript they simply won’t work at all. If I was writing an exploit I’d do this to frustrate users so hopefully they enable JavaScript and accept my exploit.“ Roger Dingledine also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029364.html\">improved</a> the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#TBBJavaScriptEnabled\">relevant question in Tor FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>One possible solution to satisfy contradicting requirements would be to<br />\nadd a “<a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9387\">security slider</a>” that would allow users to easily trade off<br />\nweb compatibility over security. The slider would have three or four different positions that would gradually deactivate more and more features of the browser. One has to understand that the “most secure” should probably disable loading of any pictures. This also impacts the Tor Browser anonymity set but this is probably a trade off that can be afforded given the actual size of the Tor Browser user base.</p>\n<p>scarp had also pined another big usability problem related to updating: “This exploit wasn’t new. […] Users running the latest Tor Browser Bundle didn’t have any issues as their browsers had been patched. It is inappropriate for a web browser to not be automatically updated.” Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005228.html\">recapitulated</a> the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2013SummerDevMeeting/BundleUpdatePlan\">latest plan</a> that was discussed during the last summer dev. meeting to simply build upon Firefox update mechanism. The next step is to do a proper review. Hopefully, given it is “mature and widespread” and has been “proven to update Firefox”, we will not “run screaming for the hills” when looking at the disadvantages.</p>\n<p>On a more general level, an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/364265592112414720\">unexpected comment</a> came from Brendan Eich (Mozilla’s chief technology officer) on Twitter: “Maybe we should just adopt, support, and bundle Tor in Firefox...”  David Dahl subsequently opened a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=901614\">bug report in Mozilla’s tracker</a> to discuss a way forward. Mike Perry <a href=\"https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/liberationtech/2013-August/010650.html\">commented on a thread on the liberationtech mailing list</a>: “In short, I am excited by this news, and I look forward to improving our communication and cooperation with Mozilla<br />\non this front.”</p>\n<h1>Tails 2013 summit</h1>\n<p>The Tails team has sent a <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/summit_2013/\">report on their 2013 development summit</a> for which “a bunch of people spend a dozen days together in July”.</p>\n<p>Read the report in full for all the details. Some highlights: task tracking have been <a href=\"https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails\">moved to Redmine</a>, <a href=\"https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/issues?query_id=112\">tasks fit for new contributors</a> has been better identified, progress has been made to <a href=\"https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/6015\">move Tails to the current Debian stable release</a>, the <a href=\"https://labs.riseup.net/code/projects/tails/roadmap\">roadmap</a> has been updated.</p>\n<p>Communication channels are going to change a little bit “to ease involvement of new contributors, to make more workload sharing possible, and to be able to provide better user support”. As a start a new <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/support/tails-support/\">user support mailing list</a> was created. Subscribe if you have questions or want to help fellow Tails users.</p>\n<p>A lot of discussions revolved around “the growth of the project: given the growing number of users and our super-short release cycle, it is a challenge to keep the project sustainable and maintainable in the mid/long term.” Give the current project exposure, the report rightfully concludes: “Tails is living decisive times, so we expect the next year to be pretty interesting. You can perhaps make the difference, so do not hesitate <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/contribute/\">joining the dance</a>!”.</p>\n<h1>Three new proposals</h1>\n<p>On Monday, Nick Mathewson robbed everyone of his “I’m a little teapot” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nickm_tor/status/365527533627777025\">performance</a> by releasing the following three new proposals:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/219-expanded-dns.txt\">Proposal 219</a> has been written a year ago by Ondrej Mikle. It is currently at draft stage. Its goal is to make Tor support any DNS query type and also support full DNSSEC resolution. The latter is important as it provides “protection against DNS cache-poisoning attacks” but is made tricky given a routine hostname resolution with DNSSEC “can require dozens of round trips across a circuit”.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/220-ecc-id-keys.txt\">another draft proposal</a>, Nick Mathewson describes a plan for a smooth transition from the current 1024-bit RSA keys used for router identity and TLS links to <a href=\"http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/\">Ed25519-SHA-512</a> keys. Several small details still have to be ironed out.  This proposal does not address hidden service keys. They will have to be addressed in another proposal once an <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/8106\">agreement has been reached</a> regarding the best crypto scheme.</p>\n<p>Now that the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/216-ntor-handshake.txt\">ntor onionskin handshake</a> has been implemented in 0.2.4, we could get better forward secrecy by having clients stop sending CREATE_FAST cells. Nick Mathewson has issued <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/221-stop-using-create-fast.txt\">proposal 221</a> to detail the reasons and the implications of such change.</p>\n<p>All these proposals are now up for discussions on the tor-dev mailing list.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Jens Kubieziel researched how to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029256.html\">get a GnuPG version for Windows</a> in a secure way, something needed for users that would like to properly verify the Tor Browser Bundle signatures on Windows systems.</p>\n<p>George Kadianakis wrote on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005231.html\">how to deploy your very own pluggable transport</a> explaining what to do before, while and after coding a new pluggable transport. Given they were designed to be “pluggable”, “it should be easy to write new [ones]”. So be sure to read these advices and start experimenting!</p>\n<p>A new round of GSoC reports arrived to the tor-dev mailing list: Johannes Fürmann about <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005237.html\">EvilGenius</a>, Cristian-Matei Toader about <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005238.html\">Tor capabilities</a>, Hareesan about the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005243.html\">Steganography Browser Extension</a>, and Kostas Jakeliunas about the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005244.html\">searchable metrics archive</a>. All of them seems to be making good progress. Let’s wish them success for the last six weeks!</p>\n<p>More reports came from the July 2013 wave: the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000310.html\">Tor Help Desk</a> by Runa Sandvik, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000311.html\">Moritz Bartl</a>.</p>\n<p>Andrew Lewman gave a talk during the US National Network to End Domestic<br />\nViolence’s (NNEDV) annual technology summit. His <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2013-07-30-NNEDV-Presentation.pdf\">presentation</a><br />\ncovered “a quick overview of Tor, why I’m here talking about domestic<br />\nviolence and intimate partner abuse, and what we’re doing to help.”.

Tails policy regarding <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/translate/\">website translations</a> specifies that “a team of translators, not just one person, is necessary”, so please join if you can help!</p>\n<h1>Help Desk Roundup</h1>\n<p>Below is a summary of some frequent questions received at the Tor help desk this past week:</p>\n<p>Users are frequently confused by the message they receive from GetTor. Currently the Tor Browser Bundle is too large to send over GetTor, so users instead receive three mirrors with a link to a page with all available translations of the Tor Browser Bundle. Many users email the help desk unsure of what this page means or which package they need.</p>\n<p>A number of users asked whether or not they needed to disable JavaScript in the Tor Browser Bundle. While the vulnerability in Firefox does not affect the latest Tor Browser Bundle, disabling JavaScript globally will reduce one’s risk of being affected by future JavaScript exploits.

    "content": "<p>I've spent the past few months developing a new build system for the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/tbb-30\">3.0 series</a> of the Tor Browser Bundle that produces what are called \"deterministic builds\" -- packages which are byte-for-byte identical no matter who actually builds them, or what hardware they use. This effort was extraordinarily involved, consuming all of my development time for over two months (including several nights and weekends), babysitting builds and fixing differences and issues that arose.</p>\n<p>When describing my recent efforts to others, by far the two most common questions I've heard are \"Why did you do that?\" and \"How did you do that?\". I've decided to answer each question at length in a separate blog post. This blog post attempts to answer the first question: \"Why would anyone want a deterministic build process?\"</p>\n<p>The short answer is: to protect against targeted attacks. Current popular software development practices simply cannot survive targeted attacks of the scale and scope that we are seeing today. In fact, I believe we're just about to witness the first examples of large scale \"watering hole\" attacks. This would be malware that attacks the software development and build processes themselves to distribute copies of itself to tens or even hundreds of millions of machines in a single, officially signed, instantaneous update. Deterministic, distributed builds are perhaps the only way we can reliably prevent these types of targeted attacks in the face of the endless stockpiling of weaponized exploits and other \"cyberweapons\".</p>\n<h1>The Dangerous Pursuit of \"Cyberweapons\" and \"Cyberwar\"</h1>\n<p>For the past several years, we've been seeing a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/10/us-usa-cyberweapons-specialreport-idUSBRE9490EL20130510\">steady increase</a> in the weaponization, stockpiling, and the use of software exploits by multiple governments, and by multiple agencies of multiple governments. It would seem that no networked computer is safe from a discovered but undisclosed and already weaponized vulnerability against one or more of its software components -- with each vulnerability being resold an unknown number of times.</p>\n<p>Worse still, with <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/security/the-real-story-of-stuxnet\">Stuxnet and Flame</a>, this stockpile has grown to include weaponized exploits specifically designed to \"bridge the air gap\" against even non-networked computers. Examples include exploits against software/hardware USB stacks, filesystem drivers, hard drive firmware, and even disconnected Bluetooth and Wifi interfaces. Even if these exploits themselves don't leak, the fact that they are known to exist (and are known to be deliberately kept secret from manufacturers and developers) means that other parties can begin looking for (or simply re-purchasing) the underlying vulnerabilities themselves, without fear of their disclosure or mitigation.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the use of such exploits isn't limited to attacks against questionable nuclear energy programs by hostile states. The clock is certainly ticking on how long it will be before multiple other intelligence agencies, along with elements of organized crime and \"terrorist\" groups, have replicated these weapons.</p>\n<p>We are essentially risking all of computing (or at least major sectors of the world economy that are dependent on specific software systems) by stockpiling these weapons, as if there would be any possibility of retaliation after a serious cyberattack. Wakeup call: There is not. In fact, the more exploits exist, the higher the risk of the wrong one leaking -- and it really only takes a chain of just a few of the right exploits for this to happen.</p>\n<h1>Software Engineering Complexity: The Doomsday Scenario</h1>\n<p>The core problem is this: With the number of dependencies present in large software projects, there is no way any amount of global surveillance, network censorship, machine isolation, or firewalling can sufficiently protect the software development process of widely deployed software projects in order to prevent scenarios where malware sneaks into a development dependency through an exploit in combination with code injection, and makes its way into the build process of software that is critical to the function of the world economy.</p>\n<p>Such malware could be quite simple: One day, a timer goes off, and any computer running the infected software turns into a brick. In fact, it's not that hard to destroy a computer via software. Linux distributions have been accidentally tripping on bugs that do it for two decades now. If the right software vector is chosen (for example, a popular piece of software with a rapid release cycle and an auto-updater), a logic bomb that infects the build systems could continuously update the timestamps in the distributed versions of itself to ensure that the infected computers are only destroyed in the event that the attacker actually loses control of the software build infrastructure. If the right systems are chosen, this destruction could mean the disruption of all industrial control or supply chain systems simultaneously, disabling the ability to provide food, water, power, and aid to hundreds of millions of people in a very short amount of time.</p>\n<p>The malware could also be more elaborate, especially if the motives are financial as opposed to purely destructive. The ability to universally deploy a backdoor that would allow modification of various aspects of financial transaction processing, stock markets, insurance records, and the supply chain records of various industries would prove tremendously profitable in the right circumstances. Just about all aspects of business are computerized now, and if the computer systems say an event did or didn't happen, that is the reality. Even short of modification, early access to information about certain events is also valuable -- unreleased earnings data from publicly traded companies being the immediate example.</p>\n<p>In this brave new world, without the benefit of anonymity and decentralization to protect single points of failure in the software engineering process from such targeted attacks, I don't believe it is possible to keep software signing keys secure any more, nor do I believe it is possible to keep even an offline build machine secure from malware injection any more, especially against the types of adversaries that Tor has to contend with.</p>\n<p>As someone who regularly discusses software engineering practices with the best and the brightest minds in the computer industry, I can tell you with certainty that even companies that exercise current best practices -- such as keeping their software build machines offline (and even these companies are few and far between) can still end up being infected, due to the existence and proliferation of the air gap bridging exploits mentioned above.</p>\n<p>A true air gap is also difficult to achieve even if it could be used to ensure build machine integrity. For example, all of the major Windows web browser vendors employ a Microsoft run-time optimization technique called \"Profile Guided Optimization\". This technique requires running an initial compiled binary on a machine to produce a profile output that represents which code paths were executed and which were most expensive. This output is used to transform its code and optimize it further. In the case of browsers, this means that an untrusted, proprietary, and opaque input is derived from non-deterministic network sources (such as the Alexa Top 1000) and transferred to the build machines, to produce executable code that is manipulated and rewritten based on this network-derived, untrusted input, and upon the performance and other characteristics of the specific machine that was used to generate this profile output.</p>\n<p>This means that software development has no choice but to evolve beyond the simple models of \"Trust our RSA-signed update feed produced from our trusted build machines\", or even companies like Google, Mozilla, Apple, and Microsoft are going to end up distributing state-sponsored malware in short order.</p>\n<h1>Deterministic Builds: Integrity through Decentralization</h1>\n<p>This is where the \"why\" of deterministic builds finally comes in: in our case, any individual can use our anonymity network to privately download our source code, verify it against public signed, audited, and mirrored git repositories, and reproduce our builds exactly, without being subject to such targeted attacks. If they notice any differences, they can alert the public builders/signers, hopefully using a pseudonym or our anonymous trac account.</p>\n<p>This also will eventually allow us to create a number of auxiliary authentication mechanisms for our packages, beyond just trusting a single offline build machine and a single cryptographic key's integrity. Interesting examples include providing multiple independent cryptographic signatures for packages, listing the package hashes in the Tor consensus, and encoding the package hashes in the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>\n<p>I believe it is important for Tor to set an example on this point, and I hope that the Linux distributions will follow in making deterministic packaging the norm. Thankfully, due to our close relationship with Debian, after we whispered in a few of the right ears <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds\">they have started work</a> on this effort. Don't despair guys: it won't take two months for each Linux package. In our case, we had to cross-compile Firefox deterministically for four different target operating system and architecture combinations and fix a number of Firefox-specific build issues, all of which I will describe in the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details\">second post on the technical details</a>.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the eighth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the great Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Future of pluggable transports integration</h1>\n<p>While David Fifield was busy updating the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en\">Pluggable Transports Bundle</a> to match the “classic” bundle version 0.2.4.16-beta-1, several discussions took place on how to better integrate pluggable transports in the future.</p>\n<p>bastik opened <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9444\">#9444</a>, pointing out that “currently TBB with Pluggable Transports are build separately, thus lagging behind”. Having two separate bundles is also a long standing usability issue, as often <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9156\">users have tried to add “obfs” bridges to their normal TBB</a>.</p>\n<p>Mike Perry is fully aware of the issue and stated in the discussion that his “long term goal is to try to cram all of the pluggable transports into The One True Bundle.”</p>\n<p>This will require modifications to the new “Tor Launcher” component of the TBB 3.x series in order to allow users to select the bridges and pluggable transports they wish to use. Compromises might be needed on how users should input bridges. BridgeDB <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/isis/bridgedb.git/commit/792cfd9\">recently stopped</a> having the “bridge” keyword in front of the addresses it replies with as Vidalia would not understand it. Mike Perry was thinking in exactly the opposite direction: “take bridge lines directly from bridgedb […] verifying only that they start with ‘bridge’”. Maybe the transition could be easier if <a href=\"https://github.com/n0la/vidalia/tree/master-bug/6724\">Florian Stinglmayr’s patch to Vidalia</a> was merged so that current bundles would <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/6724\">ignore the “bridge” keyword</a> when entering bridges.</p>\n<p>In any case, Mike wants to solve these issues “before we release as beta/stable, to minimize user confusion.”</p>\n<p>Another tricky part of the “One True Bundle” solution is the bundle size, making it harder to <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/gettor.html\">circumvent download restrictions through email</a>. But, as Mike said, “even if they don’t, we’ll probably have to find some other solution anyway for gettor, because the intersection of gettor users and PT users is probably high.”</p>\n<h1>Extended ORPort land in tor 0.2.5</h1>\n<p>After more than a year and a half in the making, the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/196-transport-control-ports.txt\">Extended ORPort mechanism</a> has been <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/commit/74262f15\">merged by Nick Mathewson into the tor master branch</a>. This will allow pluggable transport proxies to exchange arbitrary operational information and metadata with tor clients and bridges.</p>\n<p>Such plumbing was needed in order to make some pluggable transports easier to use or to allow Tor to gather more data about the state of the transports used.</p>\n<p>obfsproxy has <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/obfsproxy/network/extended_orport.py\">supported this new communication channel</a> for a little while and was only waiting for tor to catch up. George Kadianakis thus <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-August/002477.html\">asked obfsbridge operators to upgrade their tor to git master</a> to enable client statistics.</p>\n<p>Once they do, their bridges will send statistics on users per transport to the bridge authority, and they will be <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=userstats-bridge-transport&amp;transport=obfs3#userstats-bridge-transport\">published on metrics.torproject.org</a>. This helps track deployment of pluggable transports in the future.</p>\n<h1>A new implementation for the web side of check.torproject.org</h1>\n<p>Arlo Breault wrote a <a href=\"https://github.com/arlolra/check/\">new implementation for the web component of check.torproject.org</a> in the Go programming language, in response to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029306.html\">Roger Dingledine’s appeal</a>: “Check could really use some love. Any volunteers please?”.</p>\n<p>There is already a ticket to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9529\">replace the check.torproject.org servers</a> with Arlo’s Go version. Andrew Lewman stated again that “As for check.tpo website, it shouldn’t exist at all”, as it is an architectural issue to “have the entire tor browser userbase hit a single website to learn ’Tor or not’”. Until all clients are changed to stop using check, deploying a new code base would only make sense if it was at least able to handle “500 requests per second on really busy times”. More benchmarks are probably needed with Arlo’s implementation.</p>\n<p>On another front, tup, the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tordnsel.git/commit/99d490\">initial author of TorDNSEL</a>, has resurfaced to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9204#comment:14\">offer to update the code</a> to work with newer Haskell environments after many years of silence!</p>\n<h1>Tor exit crowdfunding</h1>\n<p>Moritz Bartl from <a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/\">torservers.net</a> posted an <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029431.html\">update on their ongoing crowdfunding campaign</a> to support Tor exit bandwidth. The fund just went over €3000, and there are still a few days left!</p>\n<p>For more information, and ways to contribute, please <a href=\"http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tor-anti-censorship-and-anonymity-infrastructure/\">visit the Indiegogo page</a></p>\n<h1>A Flattr-like incentive for Tor relays?</h1>\n<p>While torservers.net is presently collecting euros, George Kadianakis asked for comments from the Tor community about “a practical crowdfunded Flattr-like incentive scheme for Tor relays”, dubbed <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029419.html\">Flattor</a>.</p>\n<p>George’s proposal is meant to solve “one of the problems of scaling Tor to tens of millions of users”, that “Tor’s bandwidth capacity is finite”.  He observes that “lately the bandwidth coming out of Tor-friendly organizations (like torservers.net, universities, etc.) seems to increase” and is worried that “Tor might end up looking like the Bitcoin network — where a number of organizations (mining pools) drive the network.”</p>\n<p>What George would like to see is incentives for contributing to the network.  After studying schemes proposed in the past, all deemed “hard to implement and deploy”, George proposes a simple approach: users can opt to spend a fixed amount of bitcoins to support the Tor network, and their donation will be divided according to the bandwidth of each relay.  Obviously, relay operators who wish to receive such contributions would need to publish a bitcoin address, probably in the “contact” field.</p>\n<p>There might be some concerns with such scheme, or any monetary incentives scheme, as George summarized: “If relay operators start getting money for their bandwidth, we might end up with relay operators that are just in for the money.  It might then be easier for a three-letter org to persuade those relay operators to snoop on their users (by giving them double the money they are currently getting).”</p>\n<p>Moritz Bartl <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029421.html\">commented</a> that the idea was already quite close to torservers.net current plan, to the extent that donations were distributed “across all participating organizations based on […] advertised bandwidth and a country-specific factor.” Moritz also pointed out that similar discussions had already happened in the past when a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/turning-funding-more-exit-relays\">sponsor wished to fund faster exit relays</a>.</p>\n<p>George concluded his mail by saying that he is “not even sure if such an incentive scheme is a good idea, but posting bad ideas to mailing lists is what the Internet is for, right?”</p>\n<p>Feel free to join the discussion, or hack wildly.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>The new release of Orbot 12.0.3 comes with a shiny new icon and graphics, bugfixes, and Tor 0.2.4.16-rc. You can download the update <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android\">via Google Play</a> or straight <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/releases/orbot-latest.apk\">from Guardian Project’s website</a>.</p>\n<p>Andrew Lewman has published the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/transparency-openness-and-our-2012-financial-docs\">financial reports of the Tor Project for the year 2012</a>.</p>\n<p>Arturo has sent his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000313.html\">report for July 2013</a>.</p>\n<p>Runa Sandvik <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-August/000312.html\">reported on her trip to Black Hat &amp; DEF CON</a>. She managed to fill “the Penn &amp; Teller theater (~1500 people)” for a <a href=\"https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-speakers.html#Sandvik\">talk</a> about “the safety of the Tor network which focused on network diversity, relay operators, and misbehaving relays.” The former Tor GSoC student Brandon Wiley also gave an <a href=\"https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-21/dc-21-speakers.html#Wiley\">update</a> on <a href=\"https://github.com/blanu/Dust/\">Dust</a> — “an Internet protocol designed to resist a number of attacks currently in active use to censor Internet communication.”</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing has <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9166#comment:23\">made progress</a> on “experimenting with a client and private bridge connected over uTP”. The connection can be established, but strange timing issues remain to be solved.</p>\n<p>George Kadianakis has sent two new proposals to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005279.html\">improve hidden service identity key security</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005280.html\">prevent address enumeration</a>. TWN will cover these proposals in detail once the draft deployment strategy is published. Feel free to help refine the proposals in the meantime!</p>\n<h1>Help Desk Roundup</h1>\n<p>Users experience confusion when trying to update the Tor Browser Bundle.  Users are not always aware that the Tor Browser Bundle does not have an autoupdate function. Some users will download the latest release from the Tor Project website, then ask “Ok, what do I do now?”. We recommend closing the browser, then deleting one’s current Tor Browser folder before unpacking the new download.</p>\n<p>One person asked for help while using the Pirate Browser. Torrent-sharing website The Pirate Bay released the Pirate Browser this week as a fork of the Tor Browser Bundle. The Pirate Browser is not endorsed or recommended by the Tor Project. It is unclear what the advantages are compared to using the Tor Browser Bundle and no source code is available.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, dope457, malaparte, mttp, Karsten Loesing, and harmony.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the ninth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the determined Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Orweb Security Advisory</h1>\n<p>On August 21st, Nathan Freitas from the Guardian Project issued security advisory regarding a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029503.html\">possible anonymity flaw affecting Orweb</a>:</p>\n<p>“The Orweb browser app is vulnerable to leak the actual IP of the device it is on, if it loads a page with HTML5 video or audio tags on them, and those tags are set to auto-start or display a poster frame. On some versions of Android, the video and audio player start/load events happen without the user requesting anything, and the request to the URL for the media src or through image poster is made outside of the proxy settings”, wrote Nathan.</p>\n<p>Users who use the root mode with transparent proxying, as that handles proxying the entire traffic of the entire device or a particular app are NOT affected by this flaw.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the problem mentioned above hasn't been fixed yet, as there is <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/news-team/2013-August/000019.html\">no patch developers are happy with</a>. According to Nathan the temporary solution is ”switch to Firefox, with the appropriate set of add-ons.” The Guardian Project has updated its website with a <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/apps/proxymob-firefox-add-on/\">step by step guide</a> on how to set this up.</p>\n<h1>“Why would anyone want a deterministic build process?”</h1>\n<p>In a blog post published last week, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise\">Mike Perry explained the motivations</a> behind his three months long effort to make “deterministic builds” for the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/tbb-30\">3.0 series</a> of the Tor Browser Bundle.</p>\n<p>“The short answer is: to protect against targeted attacks” introduced Mike. With automatic remote updates becoming the norm, it becomes very interesting for a malware to “distribute copies of itself to tens or even hundreds of millions of machines in a single, officially signed, instantaneous update.” The attack shifts from attacking a millions of machines to attacking the few that are involved in “software development and build processes”.</p>\n<p>Be sure to read Mike's post to get the full picture.</p>\n<p>Mike concludes with how deterministic builds can mitigate the issue: “in [Tor] case, any individual can use our anonymity network to privately download our source code, verify it against public signed, audited, and mirrored git repositories, and reproduce our builds exactly, without being subject to such targeted attacks. If they notice any differences, they can alert the public builders/signers, hopefully using a pseudonym or our anonymous trac account.”</p>\n<p>Even if “it is important for Tor to set an example on this point”, Mike hopes that Linux distributions will follow in making deterministic packaging the norm.” It looks like at least <a href=\"http://lists.science.uu.nl/pipermail/nix-dev/2013-June/011357.html\">NixOS</a> and now <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds\">Debian</a> have started working on this.</p>\n<h1>Filters and the default Tor Browser search engine</h1>\n<p>Four months ago, an anonymous reporter complained that the search engine<br />\nused by default by the Tor Browser, Startpage, had a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/8839\">“family filter” enabled by default</a>. The reporter pointed out that it was pretty funny “for a browser that people use to evade censorship and filters”.  Another anonymous contributor quickly pointed out that the filter could be deactivated in a few clicks in Startpage preferences.</p>\n<p>The issue got some more attention a few days ago as Nick Mathewson mentioned hearing reports that the filter was blocking “LGBT stuff, which is of course serious”. Nick further identified that the filter was blocking — among several other things — search for “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Owl_and_the_Pussycat\">The Owl and the Pussy-Cat</a>”, “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pussy_Riot\">Pussy Riot</a>”, “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cheney\">Dick Cheney</a>”, “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cock_Robin_%28band%29\">Cock Robin</a>”, ”<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Cock\">Gerald Cock</a>”.</p>\n<p>Censoring 19th century poetry and repressed Russian punk bands was enough to make Nick conclude by an euphemism: “let's kill this filter hard”.</p>\n<p>Mike Perry had some insights: “What we're seeing here is actually a change in Google's Safesearch. It used to be on by default and quite a bit smarter about differentiating porn from non-porn.” Mike mailed Startpage people to explain the problem and suggests that they leave the filter off by default.</p>\n<p>In the case they would leave it on, both Nick and Mike agreed that a technical workaround should be implemented to automatically deactivate the filters when using the Tor Browser.</p>\n<h1>Sudden rise in direct Tor users</h1>\n<p>On Tuesday 27th, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029582.html\">Roger Dingledine drew attention</a> to the huge increase of Tor clients running. It seems that their number has doubled since August 19th according to the count of <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=direct-users&amp;start=2013-05-29&amp;end=2013-08-27&amp;country=all&amp;events=off#direct-users\">directly connecting users</a>.</p>\n<p>According to Roger this is not just a fluke in the metrics data. The extra <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html#dirbytes\">load on the directory authorities</a> is clearly visible, but it does not look that the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/performance.html\">overall network performance</a> are affected so far.</p>\n<p>The cause is still unknown, but there are already speculations about the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029584.html\">Pirate Browser or the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029583.html\">new “anti-piracy” law in Russia</a> which is in force since August 1<sup>st</sup>. As Roger pointed out, “some good solid facts would sure be useful.”</p>\n<h1>Help Desk Roundup</h1>\n<p>Users continue to have trouble verifying package signatures. One user was confused when the signature was automatically saved as a “.txt” file. Other problems included not being running the command from the correct directory, and downloading a signature that did not correspond with the downloaded file.</p>\n<p>Users sometimes write the help desk seeking clarification about misconceptions about Tor. Examples of such misconceptions include “Is it true that Tor is illegal in the United States?” and “Is it true that Tor has been compromised by the NSA?”. Using Tor is not currently illegal anywhere. For information about the recent vulnerability, users are advised to read the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting\">recent blog post on the subject</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>David Goulet <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005319.html\">announced the first release candidate</a> of <a href=\"https://github.com/dgoulet/torsocks\">his rewrite of torsocks</a>. Several bug reports have since been fixed from early testers. Expect a new release soon.</p>\n<p>Not all computers currently have their clock synchronized. This means that any timestamps in the Tor protocol can unfortunately be used to fingerprint Tor users. Nick Mathewson would like to improve the situation and has <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005302.html\">sent proposal 222</a>, aiming to eliminate “passive timestamp exposure”, for reviews.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing has made <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9166#comment:25\">further progress</a> on “experimenting with a client and private bridge connected over uTP”. Reduced time for client to bootstrap over uTP from 2 minutes to 6 seconds and more.</p>\n<p>Orbot's new version 12.0.5 brings identity switching-by-swiping along with a few bugfixes.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the tenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the skyrocketing Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Serious network overload</h1>\n<p><figure></p>\n<blockquote style=\"border-width: 1px;\">\n<p>&lt;borealis&gt; if it really is a coordinated attack from a bot twice the size of the regular tor network i'm much surprised tor is still usable at all</p>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><figcaption style=\"margin-left: 3em;\">— borealis in #tor, 2013-09-02 18:38 UTC</figcaption><br />\n</figure></p>\n<p>The tremendous <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=direct-users&amp;start=2013-08-15&amp;end=2013-09-02#direct-users\">influx of new clients that started mid-August</a> is stretching the current Tor network and software to its limits.</p>\n<p>Several relay operators <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-August/002594.html\">reported their relays to be saturated</a> by the amount of connections and circuits that <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-August/002589.html\">relays currently have to handle</a>.</p>\n<p>Mike Perry wishing to “compare load characteristics since 8/19 for nodes with different types of flags” issued a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-August/002612.html\">call to relay operators</a>: “especially useful [are] links/graph images for connection counts, bandwidth, and CPU load since 8/19.”</p>\n<p>It was reported on IRC that on some relays, only one circuit was successfully created out of four attempts. This unfortunately implies that clients retry to build more circuits, resulting in even more load on Tor relays.</p>\n<p>The tor 0.2.4 series introduced a new circuit extension handshake dubbed “<a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/216-ntor-handshake.txt\">ntor</a>”.  This new handshake is faster (especially on the relay side) than the original circuit extension handshake, “TAP”. Roger Dingledine came up with a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9574#comment:10\">patch to prioritize circuit creations using ntor over TAP</a>. Various observers reported that these overwhelming unidentified new clients were likely to be using Tor 0.2.3. Prioritizing ntor is then likely to make them less a burden for the network, and should help the network to function despite being overloaded by circuit creations.</p>\n<p>Sathya and Isis both reported the patch to work. Nick Mathewson pointed out a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9574#comment:12\">few issues</a> in the current implementation but overall it looks like a band-aid good enough for the time being.</p>\n<h1>Latest findings regarding traffic correlation attacks</h1>\n<p>Erik de Castro Lopo <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029755.html\">pointed tor-talk readers</a> to a new well written paper named <a href=\"http://www.ohmygodel.com/publications/usersrouted-ccs13.pdf\">Users Get Routed: Traffic Correlation on Tor by Realistic Adversaries</a>. To be presented at the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2013/\">CCS 2013 conference</a> this November in Berlin, Aaron Johnson, Chris Wacek, Rob Jansen, Micah Sherr, and Paul Syverson describe their experiments on traffic correlation attacks.</p>\n<p>This research paper follows on a long series of earlier research papers to better understand how Tor is vulnerable to adversaries controlling portions of the Tor network or monitoring users and relays at the network level.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029756.html\">wrote to tor-talk readers</a>: “Yes, a big enough adversary can screw Tor users. But we knew that. I think it’s great that the paper presents the dual risks of relay adversaries and link adversaries, since most of the time when people are freaking out about one of them they’re forgetting the other one. And we really should raise the guard rotation period. If you do their compromise graphs again with guards rotated every nine months, they look way different.”</p>\n<p>One tricky question with <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/8240\">raising guard rotation period</a> is: “How do we <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9321\">keep clients properly balanced</a> to match the guard capacities?” It is also probably another signal for any Tails supporter that wishes to help implementing <a href=\"https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5462\">guard persistence</a>.</p>\n<p>“I have plans for writing a blog post about the paper, to explain what it means, what it doesn’t mean, what we should do about it, and what research questions remain open” wrote Roger. Let’s stay tuned!</p>\n<h1>A peek inside the Pirate Browser</h1>\n<p>Torrent-sharing website The Pirate Bay started shipping a custom browser — the Pirate Browser — on August 10th. They advertised using Tor to circumvent censorship but unfortunately did not provide any source code for their project.</p>\n<p>Matt Pagan <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029703.html\">examined the contents of the package</a> in order to get a better idea of what it was. He compared the contents of the Pirate Browser 0.6b archive using cryptographic checksums to the contents of the Tor Browser Bundle 2.3.25-12 (en-US version).</p>\n<p>According to Matt’s findings the Pirate Browser includes unmodified versions of tor 0.2.3.25 and Vidalia 0.2.20. The tor configuration contains slight deviation from the one shipped with the Tor Browser Bundle. One section labeled “Configured for speed” unfortunately shows wrong understanding of the Tor network. Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029729.html\">commented in a subsequent email</a>: “Just for the record, the three lines here don’t help speed much (or maybe at all).”</p>\n<p>The remaining configuration change that “probably has the biggest impact on performance“, according to Roger, excludes exit nodes from Denmark, Ireland, United Kindgom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, China, Iran, Finland, and Norway. “Whether it improves or reduces performance [Roger] cannot say, though. Depends on a lot of complex variables around Internet topologies.”</p>\n<p>The browser itself is based of Firefox 23.0, with FoxyProxy configured to use Tor only for a <a href=\"http://piratebrowser.com/piratebrowser_patterns.json\">few specific addresses</a>, and a few extra bookmarks.</p>\n<p>Later, Matt <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029707.html\">also highlighted</a> that some important extensions of the Tor Browser, namely HTTPS Everywhere, NoScript, and Torbutton were also missing from the Pirate Browser.</p>\n<p>In any cases, the Pirate Browser is unlikely to explain the sudden influx of new Tor clients. grarpamp forwarded <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029736.html\">an email exchanged with the Pirate Browser admin contact</a> which shows that numbers (550 000 known direct downloads) and dates (“most downloads during the first week”) do not match.</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for August 2013</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of August has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000314.html\">Sherief Alaa released his report first</a>, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000315.html\">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000316.html\">Lunar</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000317.html\">Arturo Filastò</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000318.html\">Colin C.</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000319.html\">Arlo Breault</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000320.html\">Philipp Winter</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000321.html\">Roger Dingledine</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000322.html\">Karsten Loesing</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000323.html\">Isis Lovecruft</a>.

    "content": "<p>[<b>tl;dr</b>: if you want your Tor to be more stable, upgrade to a Tor Browser Bundle with Tor 0.2.4.x in it, and then wait for enough relays to upgrade to today's 0.2.4.17-rc release.]</p>\n<p>Starting around August 20, we started to see a sudden spike in the number of Tor clients. By now it's unmistakable: there are millions of new Tor clients and the numbers continue to rise:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~arma/direct-users-2013-07-07-2013-09-04.png\" alt=\"Tor users in summer 2013\" width=\"100%\"></p>\n<p>Where do these new users come from? My current best answer is a botnet.</p>\n<p>Some people have speculated that the growth in users comes from activists in Syria, Russia, the United States, or some other country that has good reason to have activists and journalists adopting Tor en masse lately. Others have speculated that it's due to massive adoption of the Pirate Browser (a Tor Browser Bundle fork that discards most of Tor's security and privacy features), but we've talked to the Pirate Browser people and the downloads they've seen can't account for this growth. The fact is, with a growth curve like this one, there's basically no way that there's a new human behind each of these new Tor clients. These Tor clients got bundled into some new software which got installed onto millions of computers pretty much overnight. Since no large software or operating system vendors have come forward to tell us they just bundled Tor with all their users, that leaves me with one conclusion: somebody out there infected millions of computers and as part of their plan they installed Tor clients on them.</p>\n<p>It doesn't look like the new clients are using the Tor network to send traffic to external destinations (like websites). Early indications are that they're accessing hidden services &mdash; fast relays see \"Received an ESTABLISH_RENDEZVOUS request\" many times a second in their info-level logs, but fast exit relays don't report a significant growth in exit traffic. One plausible explanation (assuming it is indeed a botnet) is that it's running its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botnet#Organization\">Command and Control (C&amp;C)</a> point as a hidden service.</p>\n<p>My first observation is \"holy cow, the network is still working.\" I guess all that work we've been doing on scalability was a good idea. The second observation is that these new clients actually aren't adding that much traffic to the network. Most of the pain we're seeing is from all the new circuits they're making &mdash; Tor clients build circuits preemptively, and millions of Tor clients means millions of circuits. Each circuit requires the relays to do expensive public key operations, and many of our relays are now maxed out on CPU load.</p>\n<p>There's a possible dangerous cycle here: when a client tries to build a circuit but it fails, it tries again. So if relays are so overwhelmed that they each drop half the requests they get, then more than half the attempted circuits will fail (since all the relays on the circuit have to succeed), generating even more circuit requests.</p>\n<p>So, how do we survive in the face of millions of new clients?</p>\n<p>Step one was to see if there was some simple way to distinguish them from other clients, like checking <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9653\">if they're using an old version of Tor</a>, and have entry nodes refuse connections from them. Alas, it looks like they're running 0.2.3.x, which is the current recommended stable.</p>\n<p>Step two is to get more users using the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/refs/tags/tor-0.2.4.17-rc:/ChangeLog#l769\">NTor circuit-level handshake</a>, which is new in Tor 0.2.4 and offers stronger security with lower processing overhead (and thus less pain to relays). Tor 0.2.4.17-rc comes with an added twist: we <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9574\">prioritize</a> NTor create cells over the old <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/date.html#tap:pet2006\">TAP</a> create cells that 0.2.3 clients send, which a) means relays will get the cheap computations out of the way first so they're more likely to succeed, and b) means that Tor 0.2.4 users will jump the queue ahead of the botnet requests. The Tor 0.2.4.17-rc release also comes with some new log messages to <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9658\">help relay operators track how many of each handshake type they're handling</a>.</p>\n<p>(There's some tricky calculus to be done here around whether the botnet operator will upgrade his bots in response. Nobody knows for sure. But hopefully not for a while, and in any case the new handshake is a lot cheaper so it would still be a win.)</p>\n<p>Step three is to temporarily disable some of the client-side performance features that build extra circuits. In particular, our <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/tor-0.2.4.17-rc:/ReleaseNotes#l1764\">circuit build timeout</a> feature estimates network performance for each user individually, so we can tune which circuits we use and which we discard. First, in a world where successful circuits are rare, discarding some &mdash; even the slow ones &mdash; might be unwise. Second, to arrive at a good estimate faster, clients make a series of throwaway measurement circuits. And if the network is ever flaky enough, clients discard that estimate and go back and measure it again. These are all fine approaches in a network where most relays can handle traffic well; but they can contribute to the above vicious cycle in an overloaded network. The next step is to <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9670\">slow down these exploratory circuits</a> in order to reduce the load on the network. (We would temporarily disable the circuit build timeout feature entirely, but it turns out we had a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9671\">bug where things get worse in that case</a>.)</p>\n<p>Step four is longer-term: there remain some <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9662\">NTor handshake performance improvements</a> that will make them faster still. It would be nice to get circuit handshakes on the relay side to be really cheap; but it's an open research question how close we can get to that goal while still providing strong handshake security.</p>\n<p>Of course, the above steps aim only to get our head back above water for this particular incident. For the future we'll need to explore further options. For example, we could rate-limit circuit create requests at entry guards. Or we could learn to recognize the circuit building signature of a bot client (maybe it triggers a new hidden service rendezvous every n minutes) and refuse or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarpit_%28networking%29\">tarpit</a> connections from them. Maybe entry guards should demand that clients solve captchas before they can build more than a threshold of circuits. Maybe we rate limit TAP handshakes at the relays, so we leave more CPU available for other crypto operations like TLS and AES. Or maybe we should immediately refuse all TAP cells, effectively shutting 0.2.3 clients out of the network.</p>\n<p>In parallel, it would be great if botnet researchers would identify the particular characteristics of the botnet and start looking at ways to shut it down (or at least get it off of Tor). Note that getting rid of the C&amp;C point may not really help, since it's the rendezvous attempts from the bots that are hurting so much.</p>\n<p>And finally, I still maintain that if you have a multi-million node botnet, it's silly to try to hide it behind the 4000-relay Tor network. These people should be using their botnet as a peer-to-peer anonymity system for itself. So I interpret this incident as continued exploration by botnet developers to try to figure out what resources, services, and topologies integrate well for protecting botnet communications. Another facet of solving this problem long-term is helping them to understand that Tor isn't a great answer for their problem.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Many people set up new fast relays and then wonder why their bandwidth is not fully loaded instantly. In this post I'll walk you through the lifecycle of a new fast <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#ExitPolicies\">non-exit</a> relay, since Tor's bandwidth estimation and load balancing has gotten much more complicated in recent years. I should emphasize that the descriptions here are in part anecdotal &mdash; at the end of the post I ask some research questions that will help us make better sense of what's going on.</p>\n<p>I hope this summary will be useful for relay operators. It also provides background for understanding some of the anonymity analysis research papers that people have been asking me about lately. In an upcoming blog post, I'll explain why we need to raise the guard rotation period (and what that means) to improve Tor's anonymity. [Edit: <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters\">here is that blog post</a>]</p>\n<p>A new relay, assuming it is reliable and has plenty of bandwidth, goes through four phases: the unmeasured phase (days 0-3) where it gets roughly no use, the remote-measurement phase (days 3-8) where load starts to increase, the ramp-up guard phase (days 8-68) where load counterintuitively drops and then rises higher, and the steady-state guard phase (days 68+).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~arma/lifecycle-blog.png\"><br />\n<img src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~arma/lifecycle-blog.png\" alt=\"The phases of a new relay\" width=\"100%\"></a></p>\n<p><b>Phase one: unmeasured (days 0-3).</b></p>\n<p>When your relay first starts, it does a bandwidth self-test: it builds four circuits into the Tor network and back to itself, and then sends 125KB over each circuit. This step bootstraps Tor's passive bandwidth measurement system, which estimates your bandwidth as the largest burst you've done over a 10 second period. So if all goes well, your first self-measurement is 4*125K/10 = 50KB/s. Your relay publishes this number in your relay descriptor.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#KeyManagement\">directory authorities</a> list your relay in the network consensus, and clients get good performance (and balance load across the network) by choosing relays proportional to the bandwidth number listed in the consensus.</p>\n<p>Originally, the directory authorities would just use whatever bandwidth estimate you claimed in your relay descriptor. As you can imagine, that approach made it <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#bauer:wpes2007\">cheap</a> for even a small adversary to attract a lot of traffic by simply lying. In 2009, Mike Perry deployed the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/torflow-node-capacity-integrity-and-reliability-measurements-hotpets\">\"bandwidth authority\"</a> scripts, where a group of fast computers around the Internet (called bwauths) do active measurements of each relay, and the directory authorities <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torflow.git/tree/NetworkScanners/BwAuthority/README.BwAuthorities\">adjust the consensus bandwidth up or down</a> depending on how the relay compares to other relays that advertise similar speeds. (Technically, we call the consensus number a \"weight\" rather than a bandwidth, since it's all about how your relay's number compares to the other numbers, and once we start adjusting them they aren't really bandwidths anymore.)</p>\n<p>The bwauth approach isn't ungameable, but it's a lot better than the old design. Earlier this year we plugged another vulnerability by capping your consensus weight to 20KB until a threshold of bwauths have an opinion about your relay &mdash; otherwise there was a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2286\">several-day window</a> where we would use your claimed value because we didn't have anything better to use.</p>\n<p>So that's phase one: your new relay gets basically no use for the first few days of its life because of the low 20KB cap, while it waits for a threshold of bwauths to measure it.</p>\n<p><b>Phase two: remote measurement (days 3-8).</b></p>\n<p>Remember how I said the bwauths adjust your consensus weight based on how you compare to similarly-sized relays? At the beginning of this phase your relay hasn't seen much traffic, so your peers are the other relays who haven't seen (or can't handle) much traffic. Over time though, a few clients will build circuits through your relay and push some traffic, and the passive bandwidth measurement will provide a new larger estimate. Now the bwauths will compare you to your new (faster) peers, giving you a larger consensus weight, thus driving more clients to use you, in turn raising your bandwidth estimate, and so on.</p>\n<p>Tor clients generally make three-hop circuits (that is, paths that go through three relays). The first position in the path, called the guard relay, is special because it helps protect against a certain anonymity-breaking attack. Here's the attack: if you keep picking new paths at random, and the adversary runs a few relays, then over time the chance drops to zero that *every single path you've made* is safe from the adversary. The <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#hs-attack06\">defense</a> is to choose a small number of relays (called guards) and always use one of them for your first hop &mdash; either you chose wrong, and one of your guards is run by the adversary and you lose on many of your paths; or you chose right and all of your paths are safe. Read the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards\">Guard FAQ</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>Only <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/dir-spec.txt#n1662\">stable and reliable</a> relays can be used as guards, so no clients are willing to use your brand new relay as their first hop. And since in this story you chose to set up a non-exit relay (so you won't be the one actually making connections to external services like websites), no clients will use it as their third hop either. That means all of your relay's traffic is coming from being the second hop in circuits.</p>\n<p>So that's phase two: once the bwauths have measured you and the directory authorities lift the 20KB cap, you'll attract more and more traffic, but it will still be limited because you'll only ever be a middle hop.</p>\n<p><b>Phase three: Ramping up as a guard relay (days 8-68).</b></p>\n<p>This is the point where I should introduce consensus flags. Directory authorities assign the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/dir-spec.txt#n1913\">Guard flag</a> to relays based on three characteristics: \"bandwidth\" (they need to have a large enough consensus weight), \"weighted fractional uptime\" (they need to be working most of the time), and \"time known\" (to make attacks more expensive, we don't want to give the Guard flag to relays that haven't been around a while first). This last characteristic is most relevant here: on today's Tor network, you're first eligible for the Guard flag on day eight.</p>\n<p>Clients will only be willing to pick you for their first hop if you have the \"Guard\" flag. But here's the catch: once you get the Guard flag, all the rest of the clients back off from using you for their middle hops, because when they see the Guard flag, they assume that you have plenty of load already from clients using you as their first hop. Now, that assumption will become true in the steady-state (that is, once enough clients have chosen you as their guard node), but counterintuitively, as soon as you get the Guard flag you'll see a dip in traffic.</p>\n<p>Why do clients avoid using relays with the Guard flag for their middle hop? Clients look at the scarcity of guard capacity, and the scarcity of exit capacity, and proportionally avoid using relays for positions in the path that aren't scarce. That way we <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/dir-spec.txt#n2219\">allocate available resources best</a>: relays with the Exit flag are used mostly for exiting when they're scarce, and relays with the Guard flag are used mostly for entering when they're scarce.</p>\n<p>It isn't optimal to allow this temporary dip in traffic (since we're not taking advantage of resources that you're trying to contribute), but it's a short period of time overall: clients rotate their guards nodes every 4-8 weeks, so pretty soon some of them will rotate onto your relay.</p>\n<p>To be clear, there are two reasons why we have clients rotate their guard relays, and the reasons are two sides of the same coin: first is the above issue where new guards wouldn't see much use (since only new clients, picking their guards for the first time, would use a new guard), and second is that old established guards would accrue an ever-growing load since they'd have the traffic from all the clients that ever picked them as their guard.</p>\n<p>One of the reasons for this blog post is to give you background so when I later explain why we need to extend the guard rotation period to many months, you'll understand why we can't just crank up the number without also <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9321\">changing some other parts of the system</a> to keep up. Stay tuned for more details there, or if you don't want to wait you can read the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-better-guard-rotation-parameters\">original research questions</a> and the followup research papers by <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes12-cogs\">Elahi et al</a> and <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs2013-usersrouted\">Johnson et al</a>.</p>\n<p><b>Phase four: Steady-state guard relay (days 68+).</b></p>\n<p>Once your relay has been a Guard for the full guard rotation period (up to 8 weeks in Tor 0.1.1.11-alpha through 0.2.4.11-alpha, and up to 12 weeks in Tor 0.2.4.12-alpha and later), it should reach steady-state where the number of clients dropping it from their guard list balances the number of clients adding it to their guard list.</p>\n<p><b>Research question: what do these phases look like with real-world data?</b></p>\n<p>All of the above explanations, including the graphs, are just based on anecdotes from relay operators and from ad hoc examination of consensus weights.</p>\n<p>Here's a great class project or thesis topic: using our publically available <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html\">Tor network metrics data</a>, track the growth pattern of consensus weights and bandwidth load for new relays. Do they match the phases I've described here? Are the changes inside a given phase linear like in the graphs above, or do they follow some other curve?</p>\n<p>Are there trends over time, e.g. it used to take less time to ramp up? How long are the phases in reality &mdash; for example, does it really take three days before the bwauths have a measurement for new relays?</p>\n<p>How does the scarcity of Guard or Exit capacity influence the curves or trends? For example, when guard capacity is less scarce, we expect the traffic dip at the beginning of phase three to be less pronounced.</p>\n<p>How different were things before we added the 20KB cap in the first phase, or before we did remote measurements at all?</p>\n<p>Are the phases, trends, or curves different for exit relays than for non-exit relays?</p>\n<p>The \"steady-state\" phase assumes a constant number of Tor users: in situations where many new users appear (like the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-to-handle-millions-new-tor-clients\">botnet invasion in August 2013</a>), current guards will get unbalanced. How quickly and smoothly does the network rebalance as clients shift guards after that?</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the eleventh issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the taut Tor community.</p>\n<h1>tor 0.2.4.17-rc is out</h1>\n<p>There are now <a href=\"http://blog.fox-it.com/2013/09/05/large-botnet-cause-of-recent-tor-network-overload/\">confirmations</a> that the sudden influx of Tor clients which <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029822.html\">started mid-August</a> is indeed coming from a botnet. “I guess all that work we’ve been doing on scalability was a good idea,” wrote Roger Dingledine in a blog post about <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-to-handle-millions-new-tor-clients\">how to handle millions of new Tor clients</a>.</p>\n<p>On September 5th, Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029857.html\">announced the release of the third release candidate for the tor 0.2.4 series</a>. This is an emergency release “to help us tolerate the massive influx of users: 0.2.4 clients using the new (faster and safer) ‘NTor’ circuit-level handshakes now effectively <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9574\">jump the queue</a> compared to the 0.2.3 clients using ‘TAP’ handshakes”.</p>\n<p>It also contains several minor bugfixes and some new status messages for better monitoring of the current situation.</p>\n<p>Roger <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-September/002701.html\">asked relay operators to upgrade</a> to 0.2.4.17-rc : “the more relays that upgrade to 0.2.4.17-rc, the more stable and fast Tor will be for 0.2.4 users, despite the huge circuit overload that the network is seeing.”</p>\n<p>For relays running Debian or Ubuntu, upgrading to the development branch can be done using the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en#development\">Tor project’s package repository</a>. <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-02417-rc-packages\">New versions of the beta branch of the Tor Browser Bundle</a> are also available since September 6th. The next Tails release, scheduled for <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-September/003622.html\">September 19th</a> will <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-September/003621.html\">also contain tor 0.2.4.17-rc</a>.</p>\n<p>Hopefully, this will be the last release candidate. What looks missing at this point to declare the 0.2.4.x series stable is simply enough time to finish the release notes.</p>\n<h1>The future of Tor cryptography</h1>\n<p>After the last round of revelations from Edward Snowden, <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/the_nsa_is_brea.html\">described as “explosive” by Bruce Schneier</a>, several threads started on the tor-talk mailing list to discuss Tor cryptography.</p>\n<p>A lot of what has been written is speculative at this point. But some have <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029917.html\">raised concerns</a> about 1024 bit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie–Hellman_key_exchange\">Diffie–Hellman key exchange</a>. This has already been addressed with the introduction of the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/216-ntor-handshake.txt\">“ntor” handshake</a> in 0.2.4 and Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029930.html\">encourages everybody to upgrade</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029927.html\">Another thread</a> prompted Nick to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029941.html\">summarize</a> his views on the future of Tor cryptography. Regarding public keys, “with Tor 0.2.4, forward secrecy uses 256-bit ECC, which is certainly better, but RSA-1024 is still used in some places for signatures.  I want to fix all that in 0.2.5 — see <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/220-ecc-id-keys.txt\">proposal 220</a>, and George Kadianakis’ draft hidden service improvements (<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005279.html\">descriptors</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-August/005280.html\">identity keys</a>), and so forth.” Regarding symmetric keys, Nick wrote: “We’re using AES128. I’m hoping to move to XSalsa20 or something like it.” In response to a query, Nick clarifies that he doesn’t think AES is broken: only hard to implement right, and only provided in TLS in concert with modes that are somewhat (GCM) or fairly (CBC) problematic.</p>\n<p>The effort to design better cryptography for the Tor protocols is not new. More than a year ago, Nick Mathewson presented <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/202-improved-relay-crypto.txt\">proposal 202</a> outlining two possible new relay encryption protocols for Tor cells. Nick mentioned that he’s waiting for a promising paper to get finished here before implementation.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029933.html\">third question was raised</a> regarding the trust in algorithms certified by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology\">US NIST</a>. Nick’s speculations put aside, he also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029937.html\">emphasized</a> that several NIST algorithms were “hard to implement correctly”.</p>\n<p>Nick also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029929.html\">plans to change more algorithms</a>: “Over the 0.2.5 series, I want to move even more things (including hidden services) to curve25519 and its allies for public key crypto. I also want to add more hard-to-implement-wrong protocols to our mix: Salsa20 is looking like a much better choice to me than AES nowadays, for instance.”</p>\n<p>Nick concluded one of his emails with the words: “these are interesting times for crypto”, which sounds like a good way to put it.</p>\n<h1>Toward a better performance measurement tool</h1>\n<p>“I just finished […] sketching out the requirements and a software design for a new Torperf implementation“ <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005386.html\">announced</a> Karsten Loesing on the tor-dev mailing list.</p>\n<p>The report begins with: “Four years ago, we presented a simple tool to measure performance of the Tor network. This tool, called Torperf, requests static files of three different sizes over the Tor network and logs timestamps of various request substeps. These data turned out to be quite useful to observe user-perceived network <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/performance.html\">performance over time</a>. However, static file downloads are not the typical use case of a user browsing the web using Tor, so absolute numbers are not very meaningful. Also, Torperf consists of a bunch of shell scripts which makes it neither very user-friendly to set up and run, nor extensible to cover new use cases.”</p>\n<p>The specification lays out the various requirements for the new tool, and details several experiments like visiting high profile websites with an automated graphical web browser, downloading static files, crafting a canonical web page, measuring hidden service performance, and checking on upload capacity.</p>\n<p>Karsten added “neither the requirements nor the software design are set in stone, and the implementation, well, does not exist yet. Plenty of options for giving feedback and helping out, and most parts don’t even require specific experience with hacking on Tor. Just in case somebody’s looking for an introductory Tor project to hack on.”</p>\n<p>Sathya already <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005388.html\">wrote</a> that this was enough material to get the implementation started.

According to their <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000336.html\">latest report</a>, Tails is now booted twice as much as it was six months ago (from 100,865 to 190,521 connections to the security feed).</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://enn.lu/\">Frenn vun der Enn</a> for setting up a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-September/000351.html\">new mirror</a> of the Tor project website.</p>\n<p>With the Google Summer of Code ending in two weeks, the students have sent their penultimate reports: Kostas Jakeliunas for the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005380.html\">Searchable metrics archive</a>, Johannes Fürmann for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005394.html\">EvilGenius</a>, Hareesan for the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005409.html\">Steganography Browser Extension</a>, and Cristian-Matei Toader for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005412.html\">Tor capabilities </a>.  </p>\n<p>Damian Johnson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000338.html\">announced</a> that he had completed the rewrite of <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/doctor.git\">DocTor</a> in Python, “a service that pulls hourly consensus information and checks it for a host of issues (directory authority outages, expiring certificates, etc). In the case of a problem it notifies<br />\n<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-consensus-health\">tor-consensus-health@</a>, and we in turn give the authority operator a heads up.”</p>\n<p>Matt Pagan has <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/Tor?view=revision&amp;revision=26333\">migrated</a> several <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html\">Frequently-Asked Questions</a> from the wiki to the official Tor website. This should enable more users to find the answers they need!</p>\n<p>In his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-August/002477.html\">previous call for help to collect more statistics</a>, addressed to bridge operators, George Kadianakis forgot to mention that an extra line with “ExtORPort 6669” <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-September/002691.html\">needed to be added to the tor configuration file</a>. Make sure you do have it if you are running a bridge on the tor master branch.</p>\n<p>For the upgrade of tor to the 0.2.4.x series in Tails, a tester <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-September/003617.html\">spotted a regression</a> while “playing with an ISO built from experimental, thanks to our Jenkins autobuilder”. This marks a significant milestone in the work on <a href=\"https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5324\">automated builds</a> done by several members of the Tails team in the course of the last year!</p>\n<p>Tails’ <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-September/003566.html\">next “low-hanging fruit” session</a> will be on September 21st at 08:00 UTC. Mark the date if you want to get involved!</p>\n<p>David Fifield gave some tips on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005402.html\">how to setup a test infrastructure</a> for <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/\">flash proxy</a>.</p>\n<p>Marek Majkowski <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005403.html\">reported</a> on how one can use his <a href=\"https://github.com/majek/fluxcapacitor.git\">fluxcapacitor</a> tool to get a test Tor network started with <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/chutney.git\">Chutney</a> ready in only 6.5 seconds. A vast improvement over the 5 minutes he <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005413.html\">initially</a> had to wait!</p>\n<p>Eugen Leitl <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/029856.html\">drew attention</a> to a <a href=\"http://cryptome.org/2013/09/tor-analysis-hidden-services.pdf\">new research paper</a> which aims to analyze the content and popularity of Hidden Services by Alex Biryukov, Ivan Pustogarov, and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann from the University of Luxembourg.</p>\n<h1>Tor Help Desk roundup</h1>\n<p>The Tor help desk had a number of emails this week asking about the recent stories in the New York Times, the Guardian, and ProPublica regarding NSA’s cryptographic capabilities. Some users asked whether there was a backdoor in Tor. Others asked if Tor’s crypto was broken.</p>\n<p>There is absolutely no backdoor in Tor. Tor project members have been <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/calea-2-and-tor\">vocal in the past</a> about how tremendously irresponsible it would be to backdoor our users. As it is a frequently-asked question, users have been encouraged to read <a href=\"http://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#Backdoor\">how the project would respond to institutional pressure</a>.</p>\n<p>The Tor project does not have any more facts about NSA’s cryptanalysis capabilities than what has been published in newspapers. Even if there is no actual evidence that Tor encryption is actually broken, the idea is to remain on the safe side by using more trusted algorithms for the Tor protocols. See above for a more detailed write-up.</p>\n<h1>Help the Tor community!</h1>\n<p>Tor is about protecting everyone’s freedom and privacy. There are <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/volunteer.html.en\">many ways to help</a> but getting involved in such a busy community can be daunting. Here’s a selection of tasks on which one could get started:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9698\">Get tor to log the source of control port connections</a>. It would help in developing controller applications or libraries (like Stem <a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/\"></a>) to know which program is responsible for a given access to the control facilities of the tor daemon. Knowledge required: C programming, basic understanding of network sockets.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005417.html\">Diagnose what is currently wrong with Tor Cloud images</a>. <a href=\"https://cloud.torproject.org/\">Tor Cloud</a> is an easy way to deploy bridges and it looks like the automatic upgrade procedure caused problems. Let’s make these virtual machines useful again for censored users. Knowledge required: basic understanding of Ubuntu system administration.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, dope457, mttp, malaparte, harmony, Karsten Loesing, and Nick Mathewson.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the twelfth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter that covers what’s happening in the closely-observed Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Official response to QUICK ANT disclosure</h1>\n<p>Another round of speculation regarding the attitude of state surveillance agencies towards the Tor network was provoked by <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~andrew/2013-09-10-quick-ant-tor-events-qfd.png\">a slide</a> featured in <a href=\"http://g1.globo.com/fantastico/noticia/2013/09/nsa-documents-show-united-states-spied-brazilian-oil-giant.html\">an edition of the Brazilian current-affairs show “Fantástico”</a>, broadcast on September 8th. The slide, leaked as part of the ongoing Snowden disclosures, appeared to show a tab in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/378185448293552128\">alleged GCHQ</a> FLYING PIG surveillance interface labelled “Query QUICK ANT — Tor events QFD”. <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/1m3jum/gchq_tor_events_capture/\">Users on Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jonathanmayer/status/377292928718499841\">Twitter</a> began to suggest possible attacks on Tor that might be managed through such an interface.</p>\n<p>Andrew Lewman posted an <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-nsa-gchq-and-quick-ant-speculation\">official response</a> on the Tor blog in which he reiterated that “it’s not clear what the NSA or GCHQ can or cannot do”, and that well-known theoretical attacks against the Tor network are clearly <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#AttacksOnOnionRouting\">described on the project’s FAQ page</a>.</p>\n<p>He further added that the tool in question was more likely to involve “some ‘Tor flow detector’ scripts that let them pick Tor flows out of a set of flows they’re looking at” than “anything to do with deanonymizing Tor users, except insofar as they might have traffic flows from both sides of the circuit in their database.”</p>\n<p>Finally, he remarked that instead of engaging in speculation based on limited evidence, “we’d rather spend our time developing Tor and conducting research to make a better Tor.”</p>\n<h1>Entry guards and linkability</h1>\n<p>Leif Ryge <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005423.html\">pointed out</a> an issue with Tor’s current “entry guards” system, whereby connections entering Tor from different points on the same network could potentially be linked to an individual user based on the three entry nodes selected by that user’s Tor client, which <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay\">remain constant for a period of 4-8 weeks</a>.</p>\n<p>Leif suggested that “assuming this is an accurate assessment, wouldn’t it make sense to maintain separate sets of entry guards for each network that the user connects from?”</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005424.html\">replied</a> with an acknowledgement of the problem and a number of reasons why simply generating separate sets of guards might also harm a user’s anonymity: “You would *not*, for example, want to maintain a different set of entry guards for every IP that you receive, since if you did, a hostile DHCP server could feed you new IPs until you picked a hostile guard. Similarly, if you are a busy traveler who changes your view of what network you are on hundreds or thousands of times, your chance of picking a hostile guard would rise accordingly.” He also pointed out that “having a record in your state file of every network you have visited is not necessarily the best idea either.”</p>\n<p>Nick concluded by mentioning Roger Dingledine’s proposal to lower the number of entry guards selected by a client to one only, “to avoid the property of letting guard choices identify Tor clients”.</p>\n<h1>The lifecycle of a new relay: further research needed</h1>\n<p>In response to some confusion on the part of relay operators over the apparently slow growth in the use of newly-established nodes by clients, Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay\">posted on the Tor blog</a> a detailed account of how new relays, and the bandwidth they supply, are gradually integrated into the Tor network by directory authorities, bandwidth authorities, and clients themselves. Roger stressed that “the descriptions here are in part anecdotal”.</p>\n<p>Roger outlined the four broad phases that define the development of a relay within the network, and finished by offering a number of questions for further research, under a general rubric: “what do these phases look like with real-world data?” If you would like to contribute to the Tor community’s understanding of the interaction between individual relays and the network as a whole, please take a look both at the list of sample questions and at Tor’s publicly-available <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html\">archive of metrics data</a>, and see what you can find!</p>\n<h1>Food for thought</h1>\n<p><figure></p>\n<blockquote style=\"border-width: 1px;\"><p>\nBack in the ancient pre-Tor days, at the height of the crypto wars, Ian Goldberg asked me at Financial Crypto in 1998 why we created onion routing. Not entirely facetiously I told him that the fascinating technological problems and the potential to better protect people and their activities was nice, but the real attraction was to create a context where people who were sure they should hate each other were forced to collaborate.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p><figcaption style=\"margin-left: 3em;\">— <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/030097.html\">Paul Syverson</a><figcaption><br />\n</figure></p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>The Tor help desk received a request for assistance setting up Thunderbird to work with Tor. Thunderbird can be made to route connections through Tor using the TorBirdy add-on. <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy#BeforeusingTorBirdy\">Further information</a> about using Tor with Thunderbird can be found on the wiki.</p>\n<p>Another user wrote to comment on the lack of OpenSUSE support on Tor’s <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/rpms.html\">rpm package page</a>. There is an <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/4389\">open ticket</a> concerning this issue, but it hasn’t seen activity for some months. A <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9718\">new ticket</a> was opened that addresses this concern more specifically.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>The commitment level for the proposed Tor StackExchange page is hovering at 88%; it needs to reach 100% before it will be accepted into beta.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the thirteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what's happening in the well-heeled Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Reimbursement of exit operators</h1>\n<p>In July 2012, Roger Dingledine wrote <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/turning-funding-more-exit-relays\">a post on the Tor blog</a> in which he raised the prospect of offering funding to organizations running fast Tor exit nodes. In so doing, Roger wrote, “we will improve the network's diversity as well as being able to handle more users.” He also announced that donors were already interested in financing such a scheme. Then, in April this year, Moritz Bartl <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-April/001996.html\">stated</a> that torservers.net was looking to move away from establishing additional exit nodes, in favor of providing support of various kinds to partner organizations running their own exits.</p>\n<p>These plans, and the discussion they provoked, are now about to bear fruit in the form of a financial reimbursement scheme directed at torservers.net's partner organizations. Moritz <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-September/002824.html\">wrote again</a> on the the tor-relays list to announce that reimbursements are scheduled to begin at the end of this month, drawn from a one-time donation by the U.S. Government's Broadcasting Board of Governors.</p>\n<p>The ensuing debate focused both on the technical aspects of reimbursement — that is, how best to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-September/002825.html\">determine the division of funds based on information harvested from the network metrics</a> — and the question of the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-September/002831.html\">security issues that could potentially arise from such a scheme</a>.</p>\n<p>Moritz specified that currently the only organizations to qualify for reimbursements are those that he personally knows: “so, if you’re interested in becoming a partner, start social interaction with me”, he wrote. Questions or comments regarding these proposals are welcome on the tor-relays list, and further announcements and discussion about the reimbursement system will be published on its <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-May/002138.html\">dedicated mailing lists</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tails 0.20.1 is out</h1>\n<p>Tails saw its <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.20.1/\">33<sup>rd</sup> release</a> on September 19th. The most visible change might be the upgrade of tor to version 0.2.4.17-rc, which should result in faster and more reliable access to the network after the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-to-handle-millions-new-tor-clients\">sudden bump in Tor clients</a>.</p>\n<p>Among other minor bugfixes and improvements, persistence volumes are now properly unmounted on shutdown. This should prevent data loss in some situations, and avoid a sometimes lengthy pause upon activation.</p>\n<p>It also fixes <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.20/\">several important security issues</a>. It is recommended that <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.20.1/\">all users upgrade as soon as possible</a>.</p>\n<h1>New Tor Browser Bundles released</h1>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-firefox-1709esr\">new set of stable and beta Tor Browser Bundles was released</a> on September 20th. The Tor Browser is now based on Firefox 17.0.9esr and fixes <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox17.0.9\">several important security issues</a>.</p>\n<p>Queries for the default search engine, Startpage, are no longer subject to its <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/8839\">invasive “family filter”</a>. The beta branch also include an updated version of HTTPS Everywhere that no longer causes a storm of requests to clients1.google.com, an <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9713\">issue</a> reported by many users after the last release.</p>\n<p>Once again, it is recommended that all users upgrade as soon as possible.</p>\n<h1>Tor mini-hackathon at GNU 30th Anniversary Celebration</h1>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/030154.html\">sent an invitation</a> encouraging everyone to attend the <a href=\"https://gnu.org/gnu30/celebration\">GNU 30th Anniversary Celebration</a> on September 28th and 29th at MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA. Part of the event is a hackathon, and Tor is featured alongside a few other projects. If you want to spend some of the weekend helping the Tor community, <a href=\"https://crm.fsf.org/civicrm/event/register?id=10\">sign up on the webpage</a> and come along!</p>\n<h1>Clock skew: false alarm</h1>\n<p>Small offsets in system time offer an attractive opportunity for fingerprinting Tor clients. In order to eliminate unnecessary exposure, Nick Mathewson has been working on <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/refs/heads/master:/proposals/222-remove-client-timestamps.txt\">proposal 222</a>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this process introduced a bug into the tor daemon which became apparent after the directory authority named “turtles” was upgraded. The result was that relays started to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-September/002888.html\">warn their operators</a> of an implausible clock skew. This was, of course, a false alarm.</p>\n<p>The issue was quickly worked around, and <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9798\">fixed properly</a> a few hours later.</p>\n<h1>Tor Help Desk Roundup</h1>\n<p>One user contacted the help desk for assistance running <em>torbrowser</em>, an application not affiliated with the Tor Project that attempts to mimic the Tor Browser Bundle. The <em>torbrowser</em> application violates the Tor Project’s trademark, and the Tor Project encourages users to avoid it. Multiple Tor Project developers have contacted SourceForge, which hosts this application’s website, attempting to get the project removed. Andrew Lewman <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-August/029614.html\">has said that lawyers have now been engaged</a>.</p>\n<p>A number of University students continued to contact the help desk to report difficulties circumventing their University’s Cyberoam firewall.  These students report being unable to access the Tor network even when using the Pluggable Transports Browser with obfs3 bridges. One person reported success circumventing the firewall when using an obfsproxy bridge on port 443. This issue is ongoing, but a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9601\">bug report has been filed</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Jacob Appelbaum <a href=\"http://storify.com/fredericjacobs/discussion-between-tor-s-ioerror-and-vupen-s-chaou\">inquired with VUPEN</a> about the Tor Project having the right of first refusal for Tor Browser bugs, in order to protect users.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/56447/tor\">proposed Tor page on Stack Exchange</a> has now reached 100% commitment, and will soon be launching as a live beta. Thanks to everyone who signed up!.</p>\n<p>sajolida <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-September/003703.html\">reported on the latest Tails “low-hanging fruits session”</a>. The <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-September/003696.html\">date and a tentative agenda</a> for the next online contributors meeting have also been set.</p>\n<p>As GSoC entered its final phase, Kostas Jakeliunas reported on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005483.html\">searchable metrics archive</a>, Johannes Fürmann on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005484.html\">EvilGenius</a>, and Cristian-Matei Toader on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005490.html\">Tor capabilities</a>.</p>\n<p>How can we provide Tor users an easy way to verify the signatures on Tor software? Sherief Alaa raised this question on the tor-dev mailing list when <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005491.html\">asking for comments</a> on plans to write a “small” GUI tool.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by harmony, Lunar, dope457, Matt Pagan, and Jacob Appelbaum.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the fourteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the much-discussed Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser Bundle 3.0alpha4 released</h1>\n<p>On September 28<sup>th</sup>, Mike Perry released the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30alpha4-released\">fourth alpha of the new Tor Browser Bundle 3.0 series</a>. The main highlights of this series are the important usability improvements that integrate Tor configuration and control into the browser itself, rather than relying on the unmaintained Vidalia interface.</p>\n<p>The latest iteration is based on Firefox 17.0.9esr, which brings with it a lot of important security fixes. It also fixes a fingerprinting issue by randomizing the timestamp sent when establishing an HTTPS connection.</p>\n<p>Two small but important usability improvements in the new Tor Launcher component were made: users can now directly copy and paste “bridge” lines from the <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/\">bridge database</a>, while clock-skews that would prevent Tor from functioning properly are now reported to users.</p>\n<p>Download your copy, test it, and report any problems you find. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also try out the crucial new security process by <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/README.build\">independently reproducing the binaries</a> from the publicly-reviewable source code.</p>\n<h1>Tor mini-hackathon at GNU 30<sup>th</sup> anniversary</h1>\n<p>The Tor mini-hackathon at the <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/gnu30/\">GNU 30th anniversary event</a> took place over the weekend, and Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/030238.html\">sent out a brief report</a> on how things went. As well as working on proposal 220, which involves improvements to Tor server identity keys, Nick merged some small patches into the Tor mainline branch, and collected promises of several more to come. He also directed a few enquiring minds towards Tor's online community, saying “I hope we’ll be seeing more of some of the folks I talked to on our mailing lists and IRC channels soon”.</p>\n<h1>Tor Stack Exchange page in private beta</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://tor.stackexchange.com\">Tor Stack Exchange page</a>, which <a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/56447/tor-online-anonymity-privacy-and-security\">reached 100% commitment</a> last week, has now been moved into the ‘private beta’ stage. Runa Sandvik <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-September/030187.html\">clarified</a> that “the purpose behind it is to ensure that users who committed to the site’s proposal have a chance to start asking and answering questions, as well as help with the initial community building activities that will define and shape the site”. She added that “the more experts who participate in the private beta, the more certain it is that our page will move on to the next stage (i.e. the public beta).”</p>\n<p>Fruitful discussions are already taking place: Karsten Loesing wrote to the wider community on the question of <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-September/002936.html\">what to do about contact information for bridge operators</a> after it was posed on Stack Exchange.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005519.html\">put out a call</a> for Tor developers and anonymity researchers to participate in answering questions on the site, adding “Steven, Philipp, Jens, and I can't do it by ourselves.” If you have expert knowledge to contribute, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:help@rt.torproject.org\">help@rt.torproject.org</a> to get an invitation!</p>\n<h1>liballium: Pluggable Transports utility library in C</h1>\n<p>Yawning Angel announced a new library to ease the task of writing <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html\">pluggable transports</a>. liballium is a “simple library that handles the Tor Pluggable Transport Configuration protocol. The idea is for this library to be the C/C++ equivalent to <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/pyptlib.git\">pyptlib</a> (and maybe more, depending on how much time I have to work on it).”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/Yawning/liballium\">code is available</a> for review featuring “a reasonably well commented example.”</p>\n<p>Feel free to follow up with “questions, comments, feedback”!</p>\n<h1>Tor Help Desk Roundup</h1>\n<p>Multiple users wrote to the help desk asking for guidance setting up hidden service sites. The most straightforward documentation for hidden services is in the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#torrc\">torrc file</a> itself. A <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en\">more in-depth guide</a> can be found on the Tor Project website. The website also documents how <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en\">hidden services work</a>. Technical details can be found in the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git?a=blob_plain;hb=HEAD;f=rend-spec.txt\">Rendezvous Specification document</a>.</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for September 2013</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of September has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000341.html\">Runa Sandvik</a> released her report first, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-September/000342.html\">Damian Johnson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000343.html\">Philipp Winter</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000344.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000345.html\">Noel David Torres Taño</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Mike Perry published his <a href=\"http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;search=0x29846B3C683686CC\">new GPG public key</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-September/005518.html\">adding</a>: “this new key will be used to sign email from me going forward, and will be used to sign software releases until such time as I get around to creating a second set of keys on a hardware token for that purpose”.</p>\n<p>David Fifield <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/pluggable-transports-bundles-2417-beta-2-pt3-firefox-1709esr\">updated the Pluggable Transports bundles using the latest Tor Browser Bundle</a>.

    "content": "<p>We've had several requests by the press and others to talk about the Silk Road situation today. We only know what's going on by reading the same news sources everyone else is reading.</p>\n<p>In this case we've been watching carefully to try to learn if there are any flaws with Tor that we need to correct. So far, nothing about this case makes us think that there are new ways to compromise Tor (the software or the network). The FBI says that their suspect made mistakes in operational security, and was found through actual detective work. Remember: Tor does not anonymize individuals when they use their legal name on a public forum, use a VPN with logs that are subject to a subpoena, or provide personal information to other services. See also the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download#warning\">list of warnings linked from the Tor download page</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, while we've seen no evidence that this case involved breaking into the webserver behind the hidden service, we should take this opportunity to emphasize that Tor's hidden service feature (a way to publish and access content anonymously) won't keep someone anonymous when paired with unsafe software or unsafe behavior. It is up to the publisher to choose and configure server software that is resistant to attacks. Mistakes in configuring or maintaining a hidden service website can compromise the publisher's anonymity independent of Tor.</p>\n<p>And finally, Tor's design goals include preventing even The Tor Project from tracking users; hidden services are no different. We don't have any special access to or information about this hidden service or any other. Because Tor is open-source and it comes with detailed design documents and research papers, independent researchers can verify its security.</p>\n<p>Here are some helpful links to more information on these subjects:</p>\n<p>Technical details of hidden services:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services\">https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services</a></p>\n<p>Our abuse FAQ:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq-abuse\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq-abuse\">https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq-abuse</a></p>\n<p>For those curious about our interactions with law enforcement:<br />\n<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/law-enforcement\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/law-enforcement\">https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/law-enforcement</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#Backdoor\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#Backdoor\">https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#Backdoor</a></p>\n<p>Using Tor hidden services for good:<br />\n<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/using-tor-good\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/using-tor-good\">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/using-tor-good</a></p>\n<p>Regarding the Freedom Hosting incident in August 2013, which is unrelated<br />\nas far as we can tell:<br />\n<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-freedom-hosting\">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-current-events-and-free...</a></p>\n<p>Some general hints on staying anonymous:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/overview#stayinganonymous\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/overview#stayinganonymous\">https://www.torproject.org/about/overview#stayinganonymous</a></p>\n<p>The Tor Project is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to providing tools to help people manage their privacy on the Internet.

Elsewhere on the Internet, this process is varyingly called \"deterministic builds\", \"reproducible builds\", \"idempotent builds\", and probably a few other terms, too.</p>\n<p>To produce byte-for-byte identical packages, we use <a href=\"http://gitian.org/\">Gitian</a> to build Tor Browser Bundle 3.0 and above, but that isn't the only option for achieving reproducible builds. We will first describe how we use Gitian, and then go on to enumerate the individual issues that Gitian solves for us, and that we had to solve ourselves through either wrapper scripts, hacks, build process patches, and (in one esoteric case for Windows) direct binary patching.</p>\n<h1>Gitian: What is it?</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://gitian.org/howto.html\">Gitian</a> is a thin wrapper around the Ubuntu virtualization tools written in a combination of Ruby and bash. It was originally developed by Bitcoin developers to ensure the build security and integrity of the Bitcoin software.</p>\n<p>Gitian uses Ubuntu's python-vmbuilder to create a qcow2 base image for an Ubuntu version and architecture combination and a set of git and tarball inputs that you specify in a '<a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/descriptors/linux/gitian-firefox.yml\">descriptor</a>', and then proceeds to run a shell script that you provide to build a component inside that controlled environment. This build process produces an output set that includes the compiled result and another \"output descriptor\" that captures the versions and hashes of all packages present on the machine during compilation.</p>\n<p>Gitian requires either Intel VT support (for qemu-kvm), or LXC support, and currently only supports launching Ubuntu build environments from Ubuntu itself.</p>\n<h1>Gitian: How Tor Uses It</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/README.build\">Tor's use of Gitian</a> is slightly more automated and also slightly different than how Bitcoin uses it.</p>\n<p>First of all, because Gitian supports only Ubuntu hosts and targets, we must cross compile everything for Windows and MacOS. Luckily, Mozilla <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Cross_Compile_Mozilla_for_Mingw32\">provides support</a> for <a href=\"http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/\">MinGW-w64</a> as a \"third tier\" compiler, and does endeavor to work with the MinGW team to fix issues as they arise.</p>\n<p>To our further good fortune, we were able to use a MacOS cross compiler created by <a href=\"https://github.com/mingwandroid\">Ray Donnelly</a> based on a <a href=\"https://github.com/mingwandroid/toolchain4\">fork of \"Toolchain4\"</a>. We owe Ray a great deal for providing his compilers to the public, and he has been most excellent in terms of helping us through any issues we encountered with them. Ray is also working to <a href=\"https://github.com/diorcety/crosstool-ng.git\">merge his patches</a> into the <a href=\"http://crosstool-ng.org/\">crosstools-ng project</a>, to provide a more seamless build process to create rebuilds of his compilers. As of this writing, we are still using <a href=\"https://mingw-and-ndk.googlecode.com/files/multiarch-darwin11-cctools127.2-gcc42-5666.3-llvmgcc42-2336.1-Linux-120724.tar.xz\">his binaries</a> in combination with the <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~flosoft/+archive/cross-apple/+packages\">flosoft MacOS10.X SDK</a>.</p>\n<p>For each platform, we build the components of Tor Browser Bundle in 3 stages, with one descriptor per stage. The <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/descriptors/linux/gitian-tor.yml\">first descriptor</a> builds Tor and its core dependency libraries (OpenSSL, libevent, and zlib) and produces one output zip file. The <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/descriptors/linux/gitian-firefox.yml\">second descriptor</a> builds Firefox. The <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/descriptors/linux/gitian-bundle.yml\">third descriptor</a> combines the previous two outputs along with our included Firefox addons and localization files to produce the actual localized bundle files.</p>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/tree/HEAD:/gitian/\">provide a Makefile and shellscript-based wrapper</a> around Gitian to automate the download and authentication of our source inputs prior to build, and to perform a final step that creates a sha256sums.txt file that lists all of the bundle hashes, and can be signed by any number of detached signatures, one for each builder.</p>\n<p>It is important to distribute multiple cryptographic signatures to prevent targeted attacks against stealing a single build signing key (because the signing key itself is of course another single point of failure). Unfortunately, GPG currently lacks  support for verifying multiple signatures of the same document. Users must manually copy each detached signature they wish to verify into its proper .asc filename suffix. Eventually, we hope to create a stub installer or wrapper script of some kind to simplify this step, as well as add multi-signature support to the Firefox update process. We are also investigating adding a URL and a hash of the package list the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/master:/dir-spec.txt\">Tor Consensus</a>, so that the Tor Consensus document itself authenticates our binary packages.</p>\n<p>We do not use the Gitian output descriptors or the Gitian signing tools, because the tools are used to sign Gitian's output descriptors. We found that Ubuntu's individual packages (which are listed in the output descriptors) varied too frequently to allow this mechanism to be reproducible for very long. However, we do include a <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/versions\">list of input versions and hashes</a> used to produce each bundle in the bundle itself. The format of this versions file is the same that we use as input to download the sources. This means it should remain possible to re-build an arbitrary bundle for verification at a later date, assuming that any later updates to Ubuntu's toolchain packages do not change the output.</p>\n<h1>Gitian: Pain Points</h1>\n<p>Gitian is not perfect. In fact, many who have tried our build system have remarked that it is not even close to deterministic (and that for this and other reasons 'Reproducible Builds' is a better term). In fact, it seems to experience build failures for quite unpredictible reasons related to bugs in one or more of qemu-kvm/LXC, make, qcow copy-on-write image support. These bugs are often intermittent, and simply restarting the build process often causes things to proceed smoothly. This has made the bugs exceedingly tricky to pinpoint and diagnose.</p>\n<p>Gitian's use of tags (especially signed tags) has some bugs and flaws. For this reason, we verify signatures ourselves after input fetching, and provide gitian only with explicit commit hashes for the input source repositories.</p>\n<p>We maintain a list of the most common issues in the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/README.build\">build instructions</a>.</p>\n<h1>Remaining Build Reproducibility Issues</h1>\n<p>By default, the Gitian VM environment controls the following aspects of the build platform that normally vary and often leak into compiled software: hostname, build path, uname output, toolchain version, and time.</p>\n<p>However, Gitian is not enough by itself to magically produce reproducible builds. Beyond what Gitian provides, we had to patch a number of reproducibility issues in Firefox and some of the supporting tools on each platform. These include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Reordering due to inode ordering differences (exposed via Python's os.walk())</b>\n<p>Several places in the Firefox build process use python scripts to repackage both compiled library archives and zip files. In particular, they tend to obtain directory listings using os.walk(), which is dependent upon the inode ordering of the filesystem. We fix this by sorting those file lists in the applicable places.</p>\n<li><b>LC_ALL localizations alter sorting order</b>\n<p>Sorting only gets you so far, though, if someone from a different locale is trying to reproduce your build. Differences in your character sets will cause these sort orders to differ. For this reason, we set the LC_ALL environment variable to 'C' at the top of our Gitian descriptors.</p>\n<li><b>Hostname and other OS info leaks in LXC mode</b>\n<p>For these cases, we simply patch the pieces of Firefox that include the hostname (primarily for <a href=\"about:buildconfig\">about:buildconfig</a>).</p>\n<li><b>Millisecond and below timestamps are not fixed by libfaketime</b>\n<p>Gitian relies on <a href=\"http://www.code-wizards.com/projects/libfaketime/\">libfaketime</a> to set the clock to a fixed value to deal with embedded timestamps in archives and in the build process. However, in some places, Firefox inserts millisecond timestamps into its supporting libraries as part of an informational structure. We simply zero these fields.</p>\n<li><b>FIPS-140 mode generates throwaway signing keys</b>\n<p>A rather insane subsection of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140\">FIPS-140</a> certification standard requires that you distribute signatures for all of your cryptographic libraries. The Firefox build process meets this requirement by generating a temporary key, using it to sign the libraries, and discarding the private portion of that key. Because there are many other ways to intercept the crypto outside of modifying the actual DLL images, we opted to simply remove these signature files from distribution. There simply is no way to verify code integrity on a running system without both OS and coprocessor assistance. Download package signatures make sense of course, but we handle those another way (as mentioned above).</p>\n<li><b>On Windows builds, something mysterious causes 3 bytes to randomly vary<br />\nin the binary.</b></p>\n<p>Unable to determine the source of this, we just bitstomp the binary and regenerate the PE header checksums using strip... Seems fine so far! ;)</p>\n<li><b>umask leaks into LXC mode in some cases</b>\n<p>We fix this by manually setting umask at the top of our Gitian descriptors. Additionally, we found that we had to reset the permissions inside of tar and zip files, as the umask didn't affect them on some builds (but not others...)</p>\n<li><b>Zip and Tar reordering and attribute issues</b>\n<p>To aid with this and other issues with reproducibility, we created simple shell wrappers for <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/build-helpers/dzip.sh\">zip</a> and <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/HEAD:/gitian/build-helpers/dtar.sh\">tar</a> to eliminate the sources of non-determinism.</p>\n<li><b>Timezone leaks</b>\n<p>To deal with these, we set TZ=UTC at the top of our descriptors.\n</ol>\n<h1>Future Work</h1>\n<p>The most common question we've been asked about this build process is: What can be done to prevent the adversary from compromising the (substantially weaker) Ubuntu build and packaging processes, and further, what about the <a href=\"http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/trust.html\">Trusting Trust attack</a>?</p>\n<p>In terms of eliminating the remaining single points of compromise, the first order of business is to build all of our compilers and toolchain directly from sources via their own Gitian descriptors.</p>\n<p>Once this is accomplished, we can begin the process of building identical binaries from multiple different Linux distributions. This would require the adversary to compromise multiple Linux distributions in order to compromise the Tor software distribution.</p>\n<p>If we can support reproducible builds through cross compiling from multiple architectures (Intel, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, etc), this also reduces the likelihood of a Trusting Trust attack surviving unnoticed in the toolchain (because the machine code that injects the payload would have to be pre-compiled and present for all copies of the cross-compiled executable code in a way that is still not visible in the sources).</p>\n<p>If those Linux distributions also support reproducible builds of the full build and toolchain environment (both <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds\">Debian</a> and <a href=\"http://securityblog.redhat.com/2013/09/18/reproducible-builds-for-fedora/\">Fedora</a> have started this), we can eliminate Trusting Trust attacks entirely by using <a href=\"http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/01/countering_trus.html\">Diverse Double Compilation</a> between multiple independent distribution toolchains, and/or assembly audited compilers. In other words, we could use the distributions' deterministic build processes to <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/555902/\">verify</a> that identical build environments are produced through Diverse Double Compilation.</p>\n<p>As can be seen, much work remains before the system is fully resistant against all forms of malware injection, but even in their current state, reproducible builds are a huge step forward in software build security. We hope this information helps other software distributors to follow the example set by Bitcoin and Tor.</p>"

Browser exploits, large-scale surveillance, and general user security are all challenging topics for the average internet user. These attacks make it clear that we, the broader internet community, need to keep working on better security for browsers and other internet-facing applications.\"</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the fifteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torprojet.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what's happening in the world of Tor — <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/04/tor-high-secure-internet-anonymity\">“king of high-secure, low-latency anonymity”</a>.</p>\n<h1>New tranche of NSA/GCHQ Tor documents released</h1>\n<p>After a cameo appearance in <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-nsa-gchq-and-quick-ant-speculation\">previous leaked intelligence documents</a>, Tor found itself at the center of attention in the latest installment of the ongoing Snowden disclosures after a series of stories were published in the Guardian and the Washington Post that detailed alleged attempts by NSA, GCHQ, and their allies to defeat or circumvent the protection that Tor offers its users. A number of source materials, redacted by the newspapers, were published to accompany the articles.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://media.encrypted.cc/files/nsa\">documents in question</a> offer, alongside characteristically <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EFF/status/386291345301581825\">entertaining illustrations</a>, an overview of the Tor network from the point of view of the intelligence agencies, as well as a summary of attacks against Tor users and the network as a whole that they have considered or carried out.</p>\n<p>Despite the understandable concern provoked among users by these disclosures, Tor developers themselves were encouraged by the often relatively basic or out-of-date nature of the attacks described. In response to one journalist's request for comment, Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/yes-we-know-about-guardian-article#comment-35793\">wrote</a> that “we still have a lot of work to do to make Tor both safe and usable, but we don't have any new work based on these slides”.</p>\n<p>Have a look at the documents yourself, and feel free to raise any questions with the community on the mailing lists or IRC channels.</p>\n<h1>tor 0.2.5.1-alpha is out</h1>\n<p>Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-October/030269.html\">announced</a> the first alpha release in the tor 0.2.5.x series, which among many other improvements introduces experimental support for syscall sandboxing on Linux, as well as statistics reporting for pluggable transports usage on compatible bridges.</p>\n<p>Roger warned that “this is the first alpha release in a new series, so expect there to be bugs. Users who would rather test out a more stable branch should stay with 0.2.4.x for now.” 0.2.5.1-alpha will not immediately appear on the main download pages, in order to avoid having too many versions listed at once. Please feel free to test the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">new release</a>, and report any bugs you find!</p>\n<h1>How did Tor achieve reproducible builds?</h1>\n<p>At the end of June, Mike Perry <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30alpha2-released\">announced</a> the first release of the Tor Browser Bundle 3.0 alpha series, featuring release binaries “exactly reproducible from the source code by anyone”. In a subsequent <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise\">blog post</a> published in August, he explained why it mattered.</p>\n<p>Mike has just published the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details\">promised follow-up piece</a> describing how this feat was achieved in the new Tor Browser Bundle build process.</p>\n<p>He explains how <a href=\"http://gitian.org/howto.html\">Gitian</a> is used to create a reproducible build environment, the tools used to produce cross-platform binaries for Windows and OS X from a Linux environment, and several issues that prevented the builds from being entirely deterministic. The latter range from timestamps to file ordering differences when looking up a directory, with an added 3 bytes of pure mystery.</p>\n<p>There is more work to be done to “prevent the adversary from compromising the (substantially weaker) Ubuntu build and packaging processes” currently used for the toolchain. Mike also wrote about making the build of the compiler and toolchain part of the build process, cross-compilation between multiple architectures, and the work being done by Linux distributions to produce deterministic builds from their packages.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in helping, or working on your own software project, there is a lot to be learned by reading the blog post in full.</p>\n<h1>Toward a new Tor Instant Messaging Bundle</h1>\n<p>A first meeting last week kicked-off the “<a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/Otter/Attentive\">Attentive Otter project</a>” which aims to come up with a new bundle for instant messaging. The first meeting mainly consisted in trying to enumerate the various options.</p>\n<p>In the end, people volunteered to research three different implementation ideas. Thijs Alkemade and Jurre van Bergen explored the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005544.html\">possibilty of using Pidgin/libpurple</a> as the core component. Jurre also prepared an <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005546.html\">analysis of xmpp-client</a>, together with David Goulet, Nick Mathewson, Arlo Breault, and George Kadianakis. As a third option, Mike Perry took a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005555.html\">closer look at Instantbird/Thunderbird</a> with Sukhbir Singh.</p>\n<p>All the options have their pros and cons, and they will probably be discussed on the tor-dev mailing list and at the next “Attentive Otter” meeting.</p>\n<h1>More monthly status reports for September 2013</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members continued this week with submissions from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000346.html\">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000347.html\">Lunar</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000348.html\">Sathyanarayanan Gunasekaran</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000349.html\">Ximin Luo</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000350.html\">Matt Pagan</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000351.html\">Pearl Crescent</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000352.html\">Colin C.</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000353.html\">Arlo Breault</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000354.html\">Karsten Loesing</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000355.html\">Jason Tsai</a>, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000356.html\">Tor help desk</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000357.html\">Sukhbir Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000358.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000359.html\">Mike Perry</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000360.html\">Andrew Lewman</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000361.html\">Aaron G</a>, and the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000362.html\">Tails folks</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor Help Desk Roundup</h1>\n<p>A number of users wanted to know if Tor was still safe to use given the recent news that Tor users have been targeted by the NSA.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the sixteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the venerable Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Making hidden services more scalable and harder to locate</h1>\n<p>Christopher Baines <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005556.html\">started a discussion</a> on tor-dev on the scaling issues affecting the current design of Tor hidden services. Nick Mathewson later described Christopher’s initial proposal as “single hidden service descriptor, multiple service instances per intro point” along with three other alternatives. Nick and Christopher also teamed up to produce a set of seven goals that a new hidden service design should aim for regarding scalability.</p>\n<p>There’s probably more to discuss regarding which goals are the most desirable, and which designs are likely to address them, without — as always — harming anonymity.</p>\n<p>George Kadianakis also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005621.html\">called for help</a> concerning “the guard enumeration attack that was described by the <a href=\"http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2013/papers/4977a080.pdf\">Trawling for Tor Hidden Services: Detection, Measurement, Deanonymization</a> paper (in section VII).”</p>\n<p>The most popular solution so far seems to be enabling a client or hidden service to reuse some parts of a circuit that cannot be completed successfully in order to connect to new nodes. This should “considerably <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9001\">slow the attack</a>”, but “might result in unexpected attacks” as George puts it.</p>\n<p>These problems could benefit from everyone’s attention. Free to read the threads in full and offer your insights!</p>\n<h1>Detecting malicious exit nodes</h1>\n<p>Philipp Winter <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005593.html\">asked</a> for feedback on the technical architecture of “a Python-based exit relay scanner which should detect malicious and misbehaving exits.”</p>\n<p>Aaron took the opportunity to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005596.html\">mention his plans</a> to leverage the work done as part of <a href=\"https://ooni.torproject.org/\">OONI</a> to detect network interference. Aaron’s intention is to “provide Tor network tests as part of ooni-probe’s standard set of tests, so that many individuals will measure the Tor network and automatically publish their results, and so that current and future network interference tests can be easily adapted to running on the Tor network.”</p>\n<p>Detecting misbehaving exits so they can be <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/badRelays\">flagged “BadExit”</a> by the operators of the directory authorities is important to make every Tor user safer. Getting more users to run tests against our many exit nodes would benefit everyone — it makes it more likely that bad behavior will be caught as soon as possible.</p>\n<h1>Hiding location at the hardware level</h1>\n<p>One of Tor’s goals is to hide the location of its users, and it does a reasonably good job of this for Internet connections. But when your threat model includes an adversary that can monitor which equipment is connected to a local network, or monitor Wi-Fi network probes received by many access points, extra precautions must be taken.</p>\n<p>Ethernet and Wi-Fi cards ship with a factory-determined hardware address (also called a MAC address) that can uniquely identify a computer across networks. Thankfully, most devices allow their hardware address to be changed by an operating system.</p>\n<p>As the Tails live operating system aims to protect the privacy and anonymity of its users, it has <a href=\"https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5421\">long been suggested</a> that it should automatically randomize MAC addresses. Some important progress has been made, and this week anonym <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-October/003835.html\">requested comments</a> on a detailed analysis of why, when and how Tails should randomize MAC addresses.</p>\n<p>In this analysis, anonym describes a Tails user wanting to hide their geographical movement and not be identified as using Tails, but who also wants to “avoid alarming the local administrators (imagine a situation where security guards are sent to investigate an ‘alien computer’ at your workplace, or similar)” and “avoid network connection problems due to MAC address white-listing, hardware or driver issues, or similar”.</p>\n<p>The analysis then tries to understand when MAC address should be randomized depending on several combinations of locations and devices.  The outcome is that “this feature is enabled by default, with the possibility to opt-out.” anonym then delves into user interface and implementation considerations.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in the analysis, or curious about how you could help with the proposed implementation, be sure to have a look!</p>\n<h1>Tor Help Desk Roundup</h1>\n<p>The Tor project wishes to expand its support channels to text-based instant messaging as part of the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/Otter/Boisterous\">Boisterous Otter</a> project. Lunar and Colin C. came up with a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/Otter/Boisterous/WebChat\">possible implementation</a> based on the XMPP protocol, <a href=\"https://prosody.im/\">Prosody</a> for the server side, and <a href=\"http://forge.webpresso.net/projects/prodromus\">Prodromus</a> as the basis for the web based interface.</p>\n<p>This week, multiple people asked if Tor worked well on the Raspberry Pi. Although the Tor Project does not have any documentation directed specifically at the Raspberry Pi (yet!), the <a href=\"http://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/242/how-to-run-tor-on-raspbian-on-the-raspberry-pi\">issue was raised on Tor’s StackExchange page</a>.

    "content": "<p>There are tensions in the Tor protocol design between the anonymity provided by entry guards and the performance improvements from better load balancing. This blog post walks through the research questions I raised in 2011, then summarizes answers from three recent papers written by researchers in the Tor community, and finishes by explaining what Tor design changes we need to make to provide better anonymity, and what we'll be trading off.</p>\n<h1>Part one: The research questions</h1>\n<p>In Tor, each client selects a few relays at random, and chooses only from those relays when making the first hop of each circuit. This <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards\">entry guard</a> design helps in three ways:</p>\n<p>First, entry guards protect against the \"<a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#Wright:2004\">predecessor attack</a>\": if Alice (the user) instead chose new relays for each circuit, eventually an attacker who runs a few relays would be her first and last hop. With entry guards, the risk of end-to-end correlation for any given circuit is the same, but the cumulative risk for all her circuits over time is <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#hs-attack06\">capped</a>.</p>\n<p>Second, they help to protect against the \"<a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs07-doa\">denial of service as denial of anonymity</a>\" attack, where an attacker who runs quite a few relays fails any circuit that he's a part of and that he can't win against, forcing Alice to generate more circuits and thus increasing the overall chance that the attacker wins. Entry guards greatly reduce the risk, since Alice will never choose outside of a few nodes for her first hop.</p>\n<p>Third, entry guards raise the startup cost to an adversary who runs relays in order to trace users. Without entry guards, the attacker can sign up some relays and immediately start having chances to observe Alice's circuits. With them, new adversarial relays won't have the Guard flag so won't be chosen as the first hop of any circuit; and even once they earn the Guard flag, users who have already chosen guards won't switch away from their current guards for <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay\">quite a while</a>.</p>\n<p>In August 2011, I posted these four <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-better-guard-rotation-parameters\">open research questions around guard rotation parameters</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Natural churn</b>: For an adversary that controls a given number of relays, if the user only replaces her guards when the current ones become unavailable, how long will it take until she's picked an adversary's guard?</li>\n<li><b>Artificial churn</b>: How much more risk does she introduce by intentionally switching to new guards before she has to, to load balance better?</li>\n<li><b>Number of guards</b>: What are the tradeoffs in performance and anonymity from picking three guards vs two or one? By default Tor picks three guards, since if we picked only one then some clients would pick a slow one and be sad forever. On the other hand, picking only one makes users safer.</li>\n<li><b>Better Guard flag assignment</b>: If we give the Guard flag to more or different relays, how much does it change all these answers?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For reference, Tor 0.2.3's entry guard behavior is \"choose three guards, adding another one if two of those three go down but going back to the original ones if they come back up, and also throw out (aka rotate) a guard 4-8 weeks after you chose it.\" I'll discuss in \"Part three\" of this post what changes we should make to improve this policy.</p>\n<h1>Part two: Recent research papers</h1>\n<p>Tariq Elahi, a grad student in Ian Goldberg's group in Waterloo, began to answer the above research questions in his paper <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#wpes12-cogs\">Changing of the Guards: A Framework for Understanding and Improving Entry Guard Selection in Tor</a> (published at WPES 2012). His paper used eight months of real-world historical <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/data.html\">Tor network data</a> (from April 2011 to December 2011) and simulated various guard rotation policies to see which approaches protect users better.</p>\n<p>Tariq's paper considered a quite small adversary: he let all the clients pick honest guards, and then added one new small guard to the 800 or so existing guards. The question is then what fraction of clients use this new guard over time. Here's a graph from the paper, showing (assuming all users pick three guards) the vulnerability due to natural churn (\"without guard rotation\") vs natural churn plus also intentional guard rotation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~arma/rotation-elahi.png\"> <img src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~arma/rotation-elahi.png\" alt=\"Vulnerability from natural vs intentional guard rotation\" width=\"100%\"></a></p>\n<p>In this graph their tiny guard node, in the \"without guard rotation\" scenario, ends up getting used by about 3% of the clients in the first few months, and gets up to 10% by the eight-month mark. The more risky scenario &mdash; which Tor uses today &mdash; sees the risk shoot up to 14% in the first few months. (Note that the y-axis in the graph only goes up to 16%, mostly because the attacking guard is so small.)</p>\n<p>The second paper to raise the issue is from Alex Biryukov, Ivan Pustogarov, and Ralf-Philipp Weinmann in Luxembourg. Their paper <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#oakland2013-trawling\">Trawling for Tor Hidden Services: Detection, Measurement, Deanonymization</a> (published at Oakland 2013) mostly focuses on other attacks (like how to censor or track popularity of hidden services), but their Section VI.C. talks about the \"run a relay and wait until the client picks you as her guard\" attack. In this case they run the numbers for a much larger adversary: if they run 13.8% of the Tor network for eight months there's more than a 90% chance of a given hidden service using their guard sometime during that period. That's a huge fraction of the network, but it's also a huge chance of success. And since hidden services in this case are basically the same as Tor clients (they choose guards and build circuits the same way), it's reasonable to conclude that their attack works against normal clients too so long as the clients use Tor often enough during that time.</p>\n<p>I should clarify three points here.</p>\n<p>First clarifying point: Tariq's paper makes two simplifying assumptions when calling an attack successful if the adversary's relay *ever* gets into the user's guard set. 1) He assumes that the adversary is also either watching the user's destination (e.g. the website she's going to), or he's running enough exit relays that he'll for sure be able to see the correponding flow out of the Tor network. 2) He assumes that the end-to-end correlation attack (matching up the incoming flow to the outgoing flow) is instantaneous and perfect. Alex's paper argues pretty convincingly that these two assumptions are easier to make in the case of attacking a hidden service (since the adversary can dictate how often the hidden service makes a new circuit, as well as what the traffic pattern looks like), and the paper I describe next addresses the first assumption, but the second one (\"how successful is the correlation attack at scale?\" or maybe better, \"how do the false positives in the correlation attack compare to the false negatives?\") remains an open research question.</p>\n<p>Researchers generally agree that given a handful of traffic flows, it's easy to match them up. But what about the millions of traffic flows we have now? What levels of false positives (algorithm says \"match!\" when it's wrong) are acceptable to this attacker? Are there some simple, not too burdensome, tricks we can do to drive up the false positives rates, even if we all agree that those tricks wouldn't work in the \"just looking at a handful of flows\" case?</p>\n<p>More precisely, it's possible that correlation attacks don't scale well because as the number of Tor clients grows, the chance that the exit stream actually came from a different Tor client (not the one you're watching) grows. So the confidence in your match needs to grow along with that or your false positive rate will explode. The people who say that correlation attacks don't scale use phrases like \"<a href=\"http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Sep-2008/msg00016.html\">say your correlation attack is 99.9% accurate</a>\" when arguing it. The folks who think it does scale use phrases like \"I can easily make my correlation attack arbitrarily accurate.\" My hope is that the reality is somewhere in between &mdash; correlation attacks in the current Tor network can probably be made plenty accurate, but perhaps with some simple design changes we can improve the situation. In any case, I'm not going to try to tackle that research question here, except to point out that 1) it's actually unclear in practice whether you're done with the attack if you get your relay into the user's guard set, or if you are now faced with a challenging flow correlation problem that could produce false positives, and 2) the goal of the entry guard design is to make this issue moot: it sure would be nice to have a design where it's hard for adversaries to get into a position to see both sides, since it would make it irrelevant how good they are at traffic correlation.</p>\n<p>Second clarifying point: it's about the probabilities, and that's intentional. Some people might be scared by phrases like \"there's an x% chance over y months to be able to get an attacker's relay into the user's guard set.\" After all, they reason, shouldn't Tor provide absolute anonymity rather than probabilistic anonymity? This point is even trickier in the face of centralized anonymity services that promise <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/articles/circumvention-features.html#5\">\"100% guaranteed\"</a> anonymity, when what they really mean is \"we could watch everything you do, and we might sell or give up your data in some cases, and even if we don't there's still just one point on the network where an eavesdropper can learn everything.\" Tor's path selection strategy distributes trust over multiple relays to avoid this centralization. The trouble here isn't that there's a chance for the adversary to win &mdash; the trouble is that our current parameters make that chance bigger than it needs to be.</p>\n<p>To make it even clearer: the entry guard design is doing its job here, just not well enough. Specifically, *without* using the entry guard design, an adversary who runs some relays would very quickly find himself as the first hop of one of the user's circuits.</p>\n<p>Third clarifying point: we're considering an attacker who wants to learn if the user *ever* goes to a given destination. There are plenty of reasonable other things an attacker might be trying to learn, like building a profile of many or all of the user's destinations, but in this case Tariq's paper counts a successful attack as one that confirms (subject to the above assumptions) that the user visited a given destination once.</p>\n<p>And that brings us to the third paper, by Aaron Johnson et al: <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ccs2013-usersrouted\">Users Get Routed: Traffic Correlation on Tor by Realistic Adversaries</a> (upcoming at CCS 2013). This paper ties together two previous series of research papers: the first is \"what if the attacker runs a relay?\" which is what the above two papers talked about, and the second is \"what if the attacker can watch part of the Internet?\"</p>\n<p>The first part of the paper should sound pretty familiar by now: they simulated running a few entry guards that together make up 10% of the guard capacity in the Tor network, and they showed that (again using historical Tor network data, but this time from October 2012 to March 2013) the chance that the user has made a circuit using the adversary's relays is more than 80% by the six month mark.</p>\n<p>In this case their simulation includes the adversary running a fast exit relay too, and the user performs a set of sessions over time. They observe that the user's traffic passes over pretty much all the exit relays (which makes sense since Tor doesn't use an \"exit guard\" design).  Or summarizing at an even higher level, the conclusion is that so long as the user uses Tor enough, this paper confirms the findings in the earlier two papers.</p>\n<p>Where it gets interesting is when they explain that \"the adversary could run a relay\" is not the only risk to worry about. They build on the series of papers started by <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#feamster:wpes2004\">\"Location Diversity in Anonymity Networks\"</a> (WPES 2004), <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#DBLP:conf:ccs:EdmanS09\">\"AS-awareness in Tor path selection\"</a> (CCS 2009), and most recently <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#ndss13-relay-selection\">\"An Empirical Evaluation of Relay Selection in Tor\"</a> (NDSS 2013). These papers look at the chance that traffic from a given Tor circuit will traverse a given set of Internet links.</p>\n<p>Their point, which like all good ideas is obvious in retrospect, is that rather than running a guard relay and waiting for the user to switch to it, the attacker should instead monitor as many Internet links as he can, and wait for the user to use a guard such that traffic between the user and the guard passes over one of the links the adversary is watching.</p>\n<p>This part of the paper raises as many questions as it answers. In particular, all the users they considered are in or near Germany. There are also quite a few Tor relays in Germany. How much of their results here can be explained by pecularities of Internet connectivity in Germany? Are their results predictive in any way about how users on other continents would fare? Or said another way, how can we learn whether their conclusion shouldn't instead be \"German Tor users are screwed, because look how Germany's Internet topology is set up\"? Secondly, their scenario has the adversary control the Autonomous System (AS) or Internet Exchange Point (IXP) that maximally deanonymizes the user (they exclude the AS that contains the user and the AS that contains her destinations). This \"best possible point to attack\" assumption a) doesn't consider how hard it is to compromise that particular part of the Internet, and b) seems like it will often be part of the Internet topology near the user (and thus vary greatly depending on which user you're looking at). And third, like the previous papers, they think of an AS as a single Internet location that the adversary is either monitoring or not monitoring. Some ASes, like large telecoms, are quite big and spread out.</p>\n<p>That said, I think it's clear from this paper that there *do* exist realistic scenarios where Tor users are at high risk from an adversary watching the nearby Internet infrastructure and/or parts of the Internet backbone. Changing the guard rotation parameters as I describe in \"Part three\" below will help in some of these cases but probably won't help in all of them. The canonical example that I've given in talks about \"a person in Syria using Tor to visit a website in Syria\" remains a very serious worry.</p>\n<p>The paper also makes me think about exit traffic patterns, and how to better protect people who use Tor for only a short period of time: many websites pull in resources from all over, especially resources from centralized ad sites. This risk (that it greatly speeds the rate at which an adversary watching a few exit points &mdash; or heck, a few ad sites &mdash; will be able to observe a given user's exit traffic) provides the most compelling reason I've heard so far to ship Tor Browser Bundle with an ad blocker &mdash; or maybe better, with something like <a href=\"https://www.requestpolicy.com/\">Request Policy</a> that doesn't even touch the sites in the first place. On the other hand, Mike Perry still doesn't want to ship an ad blocker in TBB, since he doesn't want to pick a fight with Google and give them even more of a reason to block/drop all Tor traffic. I can see that perspective too.</p>\n<h1>Part three: How to fix it</h1>\n<p>Here are five steps we should take, in rough order of how much impact I think each of them would have on the above attacks.</p>\n<p>If you like metaphors, think of each time you pick a new guard as a coin flip (heads you get the adversary's guard, tails you're safe this time), and the ideas here aim to reduce both the number and frequency of coin flips.</p>\n<p><b>Fix 1: Tor clients should use fewer guards.</b></p>\n<p>The primary benefit to moving to fewer guards is that there are fewer coin flips every time you pick your guards.</p>\n<p>But there's a second benefit as well: right now your choice of guards acts as a kind of fingerprint for you, since very few other users will have picked the same three guards you did. (This fingerprint is only usable by an attacker who can discover your guard list, but in some scenarios that's a realistic attack.) To be more concrete: if the adversary learns that you have a particular three guards, and later sees an anonymous user with exactly the same guards, how likely is it to be you? Moving to two guards helps the math a lot here, since you'll overlap with many more users when everybody is only picking two.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the main downside is increased variation in performance. Here's Figure 10 from Tariq's paper:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~arma/1guard-performance.png\"> <img src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~arma/1guard-performance.png\" alt=\"Average guard capacity for various numbers of guards\" width=\"100%\"></a></p>\n<p>\"Farther to the right\" is better in this graph. When you pick three guards (the red line), the average speed of your guards is pretty good (and pretty predictable), since most guards are pretty fast and it's unlikely you'll pick slow ones for all three. However, when you only pick only one guard (the purple line), the odds go up a lot that you get unlucky and pick a slow one. In more concrete numbers, half of the Tor users will see up to 60% worse performance.</p>\n<p>The fix of course is to raise the bar for becoming a guard, so every possible guard will be acceptably fast. But then we have fewer guards total, increasing the vulnerability from other attacks! Finding the right balance (as many guards as possible, but all of them fast) is going to be an ongoing challenge. See <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9273\">Brainstorm tradeoffs from moving to 2 (or even 1) guards (ticket 9273)</a> for more discussion.</p>\n<p>Switching to just one guard will also preclude deploying <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#pets13-splitting\">Conflux</a>, a recent proposal to improve Tor performance by routing traffic over multiple paths in parallel. The Conflux design is appealing because it not only lets us make better use of lower-bandwidth relays (which we'll need to do if we want to greatly grow the size of the Tor network), but it also lets us dynamically adapt to congestion by shifting traffic to less congested routes. Maybe some sort of \"guard family\" idea can work, where a single coin flip chooses a pair of guards and then we split our traffic over them. But if we want to avoid doubling the exposure to a network-level adversary, we might want to make sure that these two guards are near each other on the network &mdash; I think the analysis of the network-level adversary in Aaron's paper is the strongest argument for restricting the variety of Internet paths that traffic takes between the Tor client and the Tor network.</p>\n<p>This discussion about reducing the number of guards also relates to bridges: right now if you configure ten <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges\">bridges</a>, you round-robin over all of them. It seems wise for us to instead use only the first bridge in our bridge list, to cut down on the set of Internet-level adversaries that get to see the traffic flows going into the Tor network.</p>\n<p><b>Fix 2: Tor clients should keep their guards for longer.</b></p>\n<p>In addition to choosing fewer guards, we should also avoid switching guards so often. I originally picked \"one or two months\" for guard rotation since it seemed like a very long time. In Tor 0.2.4, we've changed it to \"two or three months\". But I think changing the guard rotation period to a year or more is probably much wiser, since it will slow down the curves on all the graphs in the above research papers.</p>\n<p>I asked Aaron to make a graph comparing the success of an attacker who runs 10% of the guard capacity, in the \"choose 3 guards and rotate them every 1-2 months\" case and the \"choose 1 guard and never rotate\" case:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~arma/room-for-improvement.png\"> <img src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~arma/room-for-improvement.png\" alt=\"Vulnerability from natural vs intentional guard rotation\" width=\"100%\"></a></p>\n<p>In the \"3 guard\" case (the blue line), the attacker's success rate rapidly grows to about 25%, and then it steadily grows to over 80% by the six month mark. The \"1 guard\" case (green line), on the other hand, grows to 10% (which makes sense since the adversary runs 10% of the guards), but then it levels off and grows only slowly as a function of network churn. By the six month mark, even this very large adversary's success rate is still under 25%.</p>\n<p>So the good news is that by choosing better guard rotation parameters, we can almost entirely resolve the vulnerabilities described in these three papers. Great!</p>\n<p>Or to phrase it more as a research question, once we get rid of this known issue, I'm curious how the new graphs over time will look, especially when we have a more sophisticated analysis of the \"network observer\" adversary. I bet there are some neat other attacks that we'll need to explore and resolve, but that are being masked by the poor guard parameter issue.</p>\n<p>However, fixing the guard rotation period issue is alas not as simple as we might hope. The fundamental problem has to do with \"load balancing\": allocating traffic onto the Tor network so each relay is used the right amount. If Tor clients choose a guard and stick with it for a year or more, then old guards (relays that have been around and stable for a long time) will see a lot of use, and new guards will see very little use.</p>\n<p>I wrote a separate blog post to provide background for this issue: \"<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay\">The lifecycle of a new relay</a>\". Imagine if the ramp-up period in the graph from that blog post were a year long! People would set up fast relays, they would get the Guard flag, and suddenly they'd see little to no traffic for months. We'd be throwing away easily half of the capacity volunteered by relays.</p>\n<p>One approach to resolving the conflict would be for the directory authorities to track how much of the past n months each relay has had the Guard flag, and publish a fraction in the networkstatus consensus.  Then we'd teach clients to rebalance their path selection choices so a relay that's been a Guard for only half of the past year only counts 50% as a guard in terms of using that relay in other positions in circuits.  See <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9321\">Load balance right when we have higher guard rotation periods (ticket 9321)</a> for more discussion, and see <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8240\">Raise our guard rotation period (ticket 8240)</a> for earlier discussions.</p>\n<p>Yet another challenge here is that sticking to the same guard for a year gives plenty of time for an attacker to identify the guard and attack it somehow. It's particularly easy to identify the guard(s) for hidden services currently (since as mentioned above, the adversary can control the rate at which hidden services make new circuits, simply by visiting the hidden service), but similar attacks can probably be made to work against normal Tor clients &mdash; see e.g. the http-level refresh tricks in <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#tissec-latency-leak\">How Much Anonymity does Network Latency Leak?</a> This attack would effectively turn Tor into a network of one-hop proxies, to an attacker who can efficiently enumerate guards. That's not a complete attack, but it sure does make me nervous.</p>\n<p>One possible direction for a fix is to a) isolate streams by browser tab, so all the requests from a given browser tab go to the same circuit, but different browser tabs get different circuits, and then b) stick to the same three-hop circuit (i.e. same guard, middle, and exit) for the lifetime of that session (browser tab). How to slow down guard enumeration attacks is a tough and complex topic, and it's too broad for this blog post, but I raise the issue here as a reminder of how interconnected anonymity attacks and defenses are. See <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9001\">Slow Guard Discovery of Hidden Services and Clients (ticket 9001)</a> for more discussion.</p>\n<p><b>Fix 3: The Tor code should better handle edge cases where you can't reach your guard briefly.</b></p>\n<p>If a temporary network hiccup makes your guard unreachable, you switch to another one. But how long is it until you switch back? If the adversary's goal is to learn whether you ever go to a target website, then even a brief switch to a guard that the adversary can control or observe could be enough to mess up your anonymity.</p>\n<p>Tor clients fetch a new networkstatus consensus every 2-4 hours, and they are willing to retry non-running guards if the new consensus says they're up again.</p>\n<p>But I think there are a series of little bugs and edge cases where the Tor client abandons a guard more quickly than it should. For example, we mark a guard as failed if any of our circuit requests time out before finishing the handshake with the first hop. We should audit both the design and the source code with an eye towards identifying and resolving these issues.</p>\n<p>We should also consider whether an adversary can *induce* congestion or resource exhaustion to cause a target user to switch away from her guard. Such an attack could work very nicely coupled with the guard enumeration attacks discussed above.</p>\n<p>Most of these problems exist because in the early days we emphasized reachability (\"make sure Tor works\") over anonymity (\"be very sure that your guard is gone before you try another one\"). How should we handle this tradeoff between availability and anonymity: should you simply stop working if you've switched guards too many times recently? I imagine different users would choose different answers to that tradeoff, depending on their priorities. It sounds like we should make it easier for users to select \"preserve my anonymity even if it means lower availability\". But at the same time, we should remember the lessons from <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#usability:weis2006\">Anonymity Loves Company: Usability and the Network Effect</a> about how letting users choose different settings can make them more distinguishable.</p>\n<p><a id=\"fix4\"></a><br />\n<b>Fix 4: We need to make the network bigger.</b></p>\n<p>We've been working hard in recent years to get more relay capacity. The result is a more than four-fold increase in network capacity since 2011:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~arma/bandwidth-since-2011.png\"> <img src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~arma/bandwidth-since-2011.png\" alt=\"Vulnerability from natural vs intentional guard rotation\" width=\"100%\"></a></p>\n<p>As the network grows, an attacker with a given set of resources will have less success at the attacks described in this blog post. To put some numbers on it, while the relay adversary in Aaron's paper (who carries 660mbit/s of Tor traffic) represented 10% of the guard capacity in October 2012, that very same attacker would have been 20% of the guard capacity in October 2011. Today that attacker is about 5% of the guard capacity. Growing the size of the network translates directly into better defense against these attacks.</p>\n<p>However, the analysis is more complex when it comes to a network adversary. Just adding more relays (and more relay capacity) doesn't always help. For example, adding more relay capacity in a part of the network that the adversary is already observing can actually *decrease* anonymity, because it increases the fraction the adversary can watch. We discussed many of these issues in the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2012-July/001433.html\">thread about turning funding into more exit relays</a>. For more details about the relay distribution in the current Tor network, check out <a href=\"https://compass.torproject.org/\">Compass</a>, our tool to explore what fraction of relay capacity is run in each country or AS. Also check out Lunar's <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/bubbles.html\">relay bubble graphs</a>.</p>\n<p>Yet another open research question in the field of anonymous communications is how the success rate of a network adversary changes as the Tor network changes. If we were to plot the success rate of the *relay* adversary using historical Tor network data over time, it's pretty clear that the success rate would be going down over time as the network grows. But what's the trend for the success rate of the network adversary over the past few years? Nobody knows. It could be going up or down. And even if it is going down, it could be going down quickly or slowly.</p>\n<p>(Read more in <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-measuring-safety-tor-network\">Research problem: measuring the safety of the Tor network</a> where I describe some of these issues in more detail.)</p>\n<p>Recent papers have gone through enormous effort to get one, very approximate, snapshot of the Internet's topology. Doing that effort retroactively and over long and dynamic time periods seems even more difficult and more likely to introduce errors.</p>\n<p>It may be that the realities of Internet topology centralization make it so that there are fundamental limits on how much safety Tor users can have in a given network location. On the other hand, researchers like Aaron Johnson are optimistic that \"network topology aware\" path selection can improve Tor's protection against this style of attack.  Much work remains.</p>\n<p><b>Fix 5: We should assign the guard flag more intelligently.</b></p>\n<p>In point 1 above I talked about why we need to raise the bar for becoming a guard, so all guards can provide adequate bandwidth. On the other hand, having fewer guards is directly at odds with point 4 above.</p>\n<p>My <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-better-guard-rotation-parameters\">original guard rotation parameters blog post</a> ends with this question: what algorithm should we use to assign Guard flags such that a) we assign the flag to as many relays as possible, yet b) we minimize the chance that Alice will use the adversary's node as a guard?</p>\n<p>We should use historical Tor network data to pick good values for the parameters that decide which relays become guards. This remains a great thesis topic if somebody wants to pick it up.</p>\n<h1>Part four: Other thoughts</h1>\n<p>What does all of this discussion mean for the rest of Tor? I'll close by trying to tie this blog post to the broader Tor world.</p>\n<p>First, all three of these papers come from the <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/\">Tor research community</a>, and it's great that Tor gets such attention. We get this attention because we put so much effort into <a href=\"https://research.torproject.org/\">making it easy</a> for researchers to analyze Tor: we've worked closely with these authors to help them understand Tor and focus on the most pressing research problems.</p>\n<p>In addition, don't be fooled into thinking that these attacks only apply to Tor: using Tor is still better than using any other tool, at least in quite a few of these scenarios. That said, some other attacks in the research literature might be even easier than the attacks discussed here. These are fast-moving times for anonymity research. \"Maybe you shouldn't use the Internet then\" is still the best advice for some people.</p>\n<p>Second, the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/\">Tails</a> live CD doesn't use persistent guards. That's really bad I think, assuming the Tails users have persistent behavior (which basically all users do). See <a href=\"https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/5462\">their ticket 5462</a>.</p>\n<p>Third, the network-level adversaries rely on being able to recognize Tor flows. Does that argue that using <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports\">pluggable transports</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges\">bridges</a>, might change the equation if it stops the attacker from recognizing Tor users?</p>\n<p>Fourth, I should clarify that I don't think any of these large relay-level adversaries actually exist, except as a succession of researchers showing that it can be done. (GCHQ apparently ran a small number of relays a while ago, but not in a volume or duration that would have enabled this attack.) Whereas I *do* think that the network-level attackers exist, since they already invested in being able to surveil the Internet for other reasons. So I think it's great that Aaron's paper presents the dual risks of relay adversaries and link adversaries, since most of the time when people are worrying about one of them they're forgetting the other one.</p>\n<p>Fifth, there are still some ways to game the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torflow.git/blob/HEAD:/NetworkScanners/BwAuthority/README.BwAuthorities\">bandwidth authority</a> measurements (here's the spec <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torflow.git/blob/HEAD:/NetworkScanners/BwAuthority/README.spec.txt\">spec</a>) into giving you more than your fair share of traffic. Ideally we'd adapt a design like <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/iptps09/tech/full_papers/snader/snader.pdf\">EigenSpeed</a> so it can measure fast relays both robustly and accurately. This question also remains a great thesis topic.</p>\n<p>And finally, as everybody wants to know: was this attack how \"they\" busted recent hidden services (<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-old-tor-browser-bundles-vulnerable\">Freedom Hosting</a>, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-and-silk-road-takedown\">Silk Road</a>, the attacks described in the latest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/04/nsa-gchq-attack-tor-network-encryption\">Guardian article</a>)? The answer is apparently no in each case, which means the techniques they *did* use were even *lower* hanging fruit. The lesson? Security is hard, and you have to get it right at many different levels.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the seventeenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor’s anonymity and guards parameters</h1>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters\">lengthly blog post</a>, Roger Dingledine looked back on three research papers published in the past year. Some of them have been covered and most of the time misunderstood by the press. A good recap of the research problems, what the findings mean and possible solutions hopefully will help everyone understand better.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/top-changes-tor-2004-design-paper-part-2\">Introduced in 2005</a>, entry guards were added to recognise that “some circuits are going to be compromised, but it’s better to increase your probability of having no compromised circuits at the expense of also increasing the proportion of your circuits that will be compromised if any of them are.” Roger “originally picked ‘one or two months’ for guard rotation” but the initial parameters called for <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-better-guard-rotation-parameters\">more in-depth research</a>.</p>\n<p>That call was heard by “the <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/\">Tor research community</a>, and it’s great that Tor gets such attention. We get this attention because we put so much effort into making it easy <a href=\"https://research.torproject.org/\"></a> for researchers to analyze Tor.” In his writing Roger highlights the finding of three papers. Two of them published at WPES 2012 and Oakland 2013, and another upcoming at CCS 2013.</p>\n<p>These research efforts highlighted several issues in the way Tor handles entry guards. Roger details five complementary fixes: using fewer guards, keeping the same guards for longer, better handling of brief unreachability of a guard, making the network bigger, and smarter assignment of the guard flag to relays. Some will require further research to identify the best solution. There are also other aspects regarding systems which don’t currently record guards such as Tails, how pluggable transports could prevent attackers from recognising Tor users, or enhancing measurements from the bandwidth authorities…</p>\n<p>The whole blog post is insightful and is a must read for everyone who wishes to better understand some of Tor’s risk mitigation strategies. It is also full of little and big things where you could make a difference!</p>\n<h1>Hidden Service research</h1>\n<p>George Kadianakis posted a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005637.html\">list of items that need work in the Hidden Service area</a>. Despite not being exhaustive, the list contains many items that might help with upgrading the Hidden Service design, be it around security, performance, guard issues or “petname” systems.</p>\n<p>Help and comments are welcome!</p>\n<h1>Usability issues in existing OTR clients</h1>\n<p>The consensus after the first round of discussions and research done in the prospect of providing a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/Otter/Attentive\">new secure instant-messaging Tor bundle</a> is to use Mozilla Instantbird at its core. Arlo Breault <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005616.html\">sent out a draft plan</a> on how to do so.</p>\n<p>Instantbird currently lacks a core feature to turn it into the Tor Messenger: support for the <a href=\"https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/\">OTR protocol</a> for encrypted chat. Now is thus a good time to gather usability issues in existing OTR clients.</p>\n<p>Mike Perry <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005636.html\">kicked off the discussion</a> by pointing out several deficiencies regarding problems with multiple clients, key management issues, and other sub-optimal behaviour.</p>\n<p>Ian Goldberg — original author of the pervasive OTR plugin for Pidgin — <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005640.html\">pointed out</a> that at least one of the behaviour singled out by Mike was “done on purpose. The thing it’s trying to prevent is that Alice and Bob are chatting, and Bob ends OTR just before Alice hits Enter on her message. If Alice’s client went to ‘Not private’ instead of ‘Finished’, Alice’s message would be sent in the clear, which is undesirable.  Switching to ‘Finished’ makes Alice have to actively acknowledge that the conversation is no longer secure.”</p>\n<p>This tradeoff is a good example of how designing usable and secure user interfaces can be hard. Usability, in itself, is an often overlooked security feature. Now is a good time to contribute your ideas!</p>\n<h1>Tor Help Desk Roundup</h1>\n<p>The Tor Help Desk continues to be bombarded with help requests from users behind university proxies who cannot use ORPort bridges or the Pluggable Transports Browser to circumvent their network’s firewall.  Although the cases are not all the same, bridges on port 443 or port 80 do not always suffice to circumvent such proxies.</p>\n<p>Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) was released this week. One user reported their Tor Browser Bundle behaving unusually after updating their Ubuntu operating system. This issue was resolved by switching to the Tor Browser Bundle 3. Another user asked when Tor APT repositories would have packages for Saucy Salamander. Since then, packages for the latest version of Ubuntu have been made available from the usual deb.torproject.org.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Tails has issued a <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/test_0.21-rc1/\">call for testing</a> of its upcoming 0.21 release.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the eighteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>A few highlights from this year’s Google Summer of Code</h1>\n<p>The Google Summer of Code 2013 program is over since the end of September. While Nick, Moritz and Damian <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-October/000367.html\">attended the GSoC Mentor Summit</a> at Google’s main campus last week, here are a few highlights from three of the five projects that were carried through the summer.</p>\n<p>Robert worked on enhancing Tor’s Path Selection algorithm. <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/ra_/tor-rtt\">The enhancement</a> uses active measurements of the Round-Trip-Time of Tor circuits. Rejecting the slowest circuits will improve the average latency of Tor circuits. The results of this work will hopefully be integrated into Tor 0.2.5.x and should then be usable by users. Robert wrote: “Working with the Tor community is very encouraging since there are highly skilled and enthusiastic people around. I am really happy to have made that decision and can definitely recommend doing so to others.”</p>\n<p>Johannes Fürmann created a censorship simulation tool that facilitates testing of applications in a simulated network which can be configured and extended to behave like censorship infrastructure in various countries. <a href=\"https://github.com/TheTorProject/EvilGenius\">EvilGenius</a> can be used to do automated “smoke testing”, i.e. find out if code still works properly if a node in the network manipulates traffic in different ways. Other than that, it can be used to automatically test decentralized network applications. “Overall, working with Tor was a great experience and I hope to be able to work with the Tor community again” said Johannes.</p>\n<p>Kostas Jakeliūnas worked on creating a <a href=\"http://github.com/wfn/torsearch\">searchable and scalable Tor Metrics data archive</a>. This required implementing a Tor relay consensus and descriptor search backend that can encompass most of the archival data available (as of now, the currently running backend covers relays from 2008 up until now).</p>\n<p>Those curious to browse Tor relay archives — searching for a needle in the very large haystack or just looking around — might enjoy playing with the <a href=\"http://ts.mkj.lt:5555/\">current test platform</a>. It can run powerful queries on the large dataset without query parameter/span restrictions. Many <a href=\"https://github.com/wfn/torsearch/blob/master/docs/use_cases_examples.md\">use cases</a> are supported — for example, since the newest consensus data is always available, the backend can be used in an ExoneraTor-like fashion.</p>\n<p>Together with Karsten Loesing, Kostas hopes to integrate this system with the current <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/onionoo.html\">Onionoo</a>, hopefully further empowering (and eventually simplifying) the overall Tor Metrics ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Kostas described the project as “an interesting and challenging one — a lot of work […] to make it robust and truly scalable.” He also added: “Working with Tor was a great experience: I found the developer community to be welcoming indeed, comprised of many people who are professionals in their field.  It should be noted that where there are interesting problems and a clear cause, great people assemble.”</p>\n<h1>Collecting data against network level adversaries</h1>\n<p>“The anonymity of a connection over Tor is vulnerable to an adversary who can observe it in enough places along its route.  For example, traffic that crosses the same country as it enters and leaves the Tor network can potentially be deanonymized by an authority in that country who can monitor all network communication.” Karsten Loesing, Anupam Das, and Nikita Borisov began their <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-October/003113.html\">call for help to Tor relay operators</a> by stating a problem that has recently attracted some interest by the research community.</p>\n<p>The question “which part of the Internet does a Tor relay lie in” is easy enough to answer, but “determining routes with high confidence has been difficult“ so far. The best source of information could come from the relay operators, as Karsten et al. wrote: “To figure out where traffic travels from your relay, we’d like you to run a bunch of ‘traceroutes’ — network measurements that show the paths traffic takes.”</p>\n<p>This one-time experiment — for now — is meant to be used by “several researchers, but the leads are Anupam Das, a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and his advisor Nikita Borisov.”</p>\n<p>In order to participate, shell scripts are available which automate most of the process. They have been reviewed with care from several members of the Tor community and are available from <a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/anupam_das/traceroute-from-tor-relays\">a Git repository</a>.  Since their initial email, Anupam Das has assembled a <a href=\"http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~das17/tor-traceroute_v1.html#faq\">FAQ regarding scope, resource consumption, and other topics</a>.</p>\n<p>Be sure to run the scripts if you can. As Karsten, Anupam, and Nikita concluded, “with your help, we will keep improving to face the new challenges to privacy and freedom online.”</p>\n<h1>Tor Help Desk Roundup</h1>\n<p>Using the Tor Browser Bundle is still proving to be tricky for many Ubuntu users who upgraded from Ubuntu 13.04 to 13.10. The commonly reported error is that users cannot enter text in any of the browser’s text fields, including the URL and search bars. So far this problem appears to be resolved by removing ibus with apt-get before running the Tor Browser. Users who need ibus can try running `export GTK_IM_MODULE=xim`, as documented in <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9353\">Trac ticket #9353</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>David Goulet is asking for a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10007\">final round of reviews of his rewrite of torsocks</a> so it can replace the old implementation. Lunar has <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-October/030730.html\">updated the package in Debian experimental</a> to encourage testing. A few portability bugs and a deadlock <a href=\"https://github.com/dgoulet/torsocks/commit/e55eae3d3\"></a> has already been ironed out in the process.</p>\n<p>The next Tails contributor meeting will be <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-October/003956.html\">held on November 6th</a>.

On top of these specific changes, the release include <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.20.1/\">security fixes</a> from the Firefox 17.0.10esr release and for a few other Debian packages.</p>\n<p>More visible improvements include the ability to persist printer settings, support for running from more SD card reader types, and a panel launcher for the password manager.

Sites that use HTTPS can purchase different types of SSL certificates. Some certificate issuers offer certificates that supply ownership information, such  as the physical address of the website operator, for a higher price. Sites that use  these certificates get the lock icon by their URL outlined in green. The Tor Project  adds protection to the validity of our SSL certificate a different way, by supplying our <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html#SSLcertfingerprint\">SSL certificate fingerprint on our FAQ page</a>. You can double check that  fingerprint on any of the <a href=\"https://torproject.org/getinvolved/mirrors.html\">Tor Project's mirror pages</a> as well.</p>\n<p>One person wanted to known why a website they were visiting over Firefox was telling them that they were not using Tor, even though Vidalia told them that Tor was running. By default, the Tor Browser Bundle does not anonymize all the traffic on your computer. Only the traffic you send through the Tor Browser Bundle will be anonymized. If you  have Firefox and the Tor Browser open at the same time, the traffic you send through Firefox will not be anonymous. Using Firefox and Tor Browser Bundle at the same time is  not a great idea because the two interfaces are almost identical, and it is easy to get  the two browsers mixed up, even if you know what you are doing.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/torbirdy-012-our-third-beta-release\">third beta release of TorBirdy has been released</a> as version 0.1.2.

    "content": "<p>Website traffic fingerprinting is an attack where the adversary attempts to recognize the encrypted traffic patterns of specific web pages without using any other information. In the case of Tor, this attack would take place between the user and the Guard node, or at the Guard node itself.</p>\n<p>There are two models under which these attacks are typically studied: The \"closed world\" scenario, and the \"open world\" scenario. In the \"closed world\" scenario, the only traffic patterns the classifier ever sees are for web pages that it has already been trained on, and it typically must successfully label all of them. This is meant to simulate situations where users only use Tor for viewing a small set of censored web pages and nothing else. The \"open world\" scenario is slightly more realistic in that it attempts to examine the ability of the adversary to recognize a few censored pages out of a much larger set of uncensored pages, some of which it has never seen before.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that in both models, these papers are reporting results on their ability to classify individual <b>pages</b> and not overall websites, despite often using the terms website and webpage interchangeably. </p>\n<p>The most comprehensive study of the statistical properties of this attack against Tor was done by Panchenko et al. In their \"closed world\" study, they evaluated their success rates of classifying 775 web pages. In their \"open world\" study, they classified a handful of censored pages in 5000 page subsets of 1,000,000 total web pages.</p>\n<p>Since then, a series of smaller scale follow-on attack papers have claimed improved success rates since Panchenko's study, and in at least two instances these papers even claimed to completely invalidate any attempt at defense based only on partial results.</p>\n<p>While there may have been some improvements in classifier accuracy in these papers over Panchenko, defenses were \"broken\" and dismissed primarily by taking a number of shortcuts that ignore basic properties of machine learning theory and statistics in order to enable their claims of success.</p>\n<p>Despite these subsequent improvements in these attacks, we are still skeptical of the efficacy of this attack in a real world scenario, and believe that only minimal defenses will be needed to ensure the attack continues to be unusable in practice.</p>\n<p>This post will be divided into the following areas: First, we will attempt to distill the adversary model used by this body of work, and describe the adversary's goals. Then, we will review the basic properties of machine learning theory and statistics that govern classifier accuracy and real-world performance.  Next, we will make these properties concrete by briefly discussing additional real-world sources of hidden complexity in the website traffic fingerprinting problem domain. We will then specifically enumerate both the useful contributions and the shortcuts taken by various work to date.  Finally, we will conclude with suggestions and areas for improvement in future work.</p>\n<h2>Pinning Down the Adversary Model</h2>\n<p>Website traffic fingerprinting attack papers assume that an adversary is for some reason either unmotivated or unable to block Tor outright, but is instead very interested in detecting patterns of specific activity inside Tor-like traffic flows.</p>\n<p>The exact motivation for this effort on behalf of the adversary is typically not specified, but there seem to be three possibilities, in order of increasing difficulty for the adversary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The adversary is interested in blocking specific censored webpage traffic patterns, while still leaving the rest of the Tor-like traffic unmolested (perhaps because Tor's packet obfuscation layer looks like something legitimate that the adversary wants to avoid blocking).\n<li>The adversary is interested in identifying all of the users that visit a small, specific set of targeted pages.\n<li>The adversary is interested in recognizing every single web page a user visits.\n</ol>\n<p><br>Unfortunately, it seems that machine learning complexity theory and basic statistics are heavily stacked against all three of these goals.</p>\n<h2>Theoretical Issues: Factors Affecting Classification Accuracy</h2>\n<p>Machine Learning theory tells us that the accuracy of a classifier is affected by four main factors: the size of the hypothesis space (ie the information-theoretic complexity of the classification categories), the accuracy of feature extraction and representation (the bias in the hypothesis space), the size of the instance space (the world size), and the number of training examples provided to the classifier.</p>\n<p>Bounds have actually been established on the effect of each of these areas to the likelihood of achieving a given accuracy rate, and any good undergraduate course in Machine Learning will cover these topics in detail. For a concise review of these accuracy bounds, we recommend Chapters 5 and 7 of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Machine-Learning-Tom-M-Mitchell/dp/0070428077\">Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell</a>.</p>\n<p>The brief summary is this: as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC_dimension\">number and/or complexity of classification categories</a> increases while reliable feature information does not, the classifier eventually runs out of descriptive feature information, and either true positive accuracy goes down or the false positive rate goes up. This error is called the <a href=\"http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/csep573/98sp/lectures/lecture8/sld050.htm\">bias in the hypothesis space</a>. In fact, even for unbiased hypothesis spaces, the number of training examples required to achieve a reasonable error bound is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning#Equivalence\">a function of</a> the number and complexity of the classification categories.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the effects of all of these factors are actually observable in the papers that managed to study a sufficient world size.</p>\n<p>First, for the same world size and classifier technique, every work that examined both the open and closed worlds reports much higher accuracy rates for the open world than for the closed world. This is due to the higher hypothesis space complexity involved in labeling every page in the closed world, as opposed to labeling only a very small subset of censored targets in the open world. This confirms the above machine learning theory, and tells us that that an adversary that is attempting to recognize every single web page in existence is going to have a very difficult time getting any accuracy, as compared to one who is classifying only a select interesting subset.</p>\n<p>It is also clearly visible in <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/wpes11-panchenko.pdf\">Panchenko's large-scale open world study</a> that increasing the world size contributes to a slower, but still steady decline in open world accuracy in Figure 4 below. The effect of the hypothesis space complexity (increased number of pages to classify) on the open world can also be seen in the rising false positive rates of Figure 5 below (this rise may seem small, but in the next section we will show how even tiny increases in false positives are in fact devastating to the attack).</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/images/Fig4.png\" width=\"49%\"> <img src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/images/Fig5.png\" width=\"49%\">\n</div>\n<p>Every other attack paper since then has neglected to use world sizes large enough to observe these effects in sufficient detail, but again, machine learning theory tells us they are still there, just beyond the published data points.</p>\n<h2>Practical Issues: False Positives Matter. A Lot.</h2>\n<p>Beyond classifier accuracy and the factors that affect it, the practical applicability of the website traffic fingerprinting attack is also affected by some basic statistical results. These statistics (which <a href=\"http://www.raid-symposium.org/raid99/PAPERS/Axelsson.pdf\">have been examined</a> in other computer security-related application domains of machine learning) show that false positives end up destroying the effectiveness of classification unless they are vanishingly small (much less than 10^-6).</p>\n<p>It actually turns out that false positives are especially damaging to this attack, perhaps even more so than most other application domains. In the website traffic fingerprinting attack, false positive results are a built-in property of the world: if one or more pages' traffic patterns are similar enough to a target page's pattern to trigger a false positive, these sets of pages will always be misclassified as the target page every time that traffic pattern is present. Unlike end-to-end timing correlation, the adversary does not get to benefit from information derived from repeated visits (except in narrow, contrived scenarios that we will address in our literature review below).</p>\n<p>What's more is that this also means that small world sizes directly impact the false positive rate. As you increase the world size, the likelihood of including a page that matches a traffic stream of your target page also increases.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate the damaging effects of false positives on the attack, we will now consider the effects of false positives on the adversary's two remaining feasible goals: flagging users who visit a specific controversial web page over Tor, and censoring only a subset of Tor-like traffic.</p>\n<p>In the event where the adversary is attempting to recognize visits to highly sensitive material (such as a specific web page about a particular protest action) and is interested in gathering a list of suspects who visit the web page, it is easy to see that even with very high accuracy rates, the suspect list quickly grows without bound.</p>\n<p>To see this, note that the probability of at least one false positive over N independent page loads is given by <b>1 - (1-fp)^N</b>, where fp is the probability of a false positive.</p>\n<p>Even with a false positive rate as low as 0.2% (which is typical for this literature, and again is also lower than reality due to small world sizes), after performing just N=100 different page loads, 18% of the userbase will be falsely accused of visiting targeted material at least once. After each user has performed N=1000 different page loads, 86.5% of that user base will have been falsely accused of visiting the target page at least once. In fact, many of these users will be falsely accused much more frequently than that (as per the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Probability_mass_function\">Binomial Distribution</a>).</p>\n<p>If instead of trying to enumerate specific visitors, the adversary is trying to interfere with the traffic patterns of certain web pages, the accuracy value that matters is the Bayesian Detection Rate, which is the probability that a traffic pattern was actually due to a censored/target page visit given that the detector said it was recognized. This is written as <b>P(Censored|Classified)</b>.</p>\n<p>Using Bayes Theorem, it is possible to convert from the true and false positive rates of <b>P(Classified|Censored)</b> and <b>P(Classified|~Censored)</b> to the Bayesian Detection Rate of <b>P(Censored|Classified)</b> like so:</p>\n<pre>\nP(Censored|Classified) =\n P(Classified|Censored)*P(Censored) /\n  (P(Censored)*P(Classified|Censored) + \n   P(~Censored)*P(Classified|~Censored))\n</pre><p>\nUnder conditions of low censorship (0.1% -- such as when the Tor traffic successfully blends in with a large volume of innocuous Internet traffic, or when Tor is used for both censorship circumvention and general privacy), with a true positive rate of 0.6 and a false positive rate of 0.005, we have:</p>\n<pre>\nP(Censored|Classified) = 0.6*.001/(.001*0.6+.999*.005)\nP(Censored|Classified) = 0.10\nP(~Censored|Classified) = 1 - P(Censored|Classified)\nP(~Censored|Classified) = 0.90\n</pre><p>\nThis means that when a traffic pattern is classified as a censored/target page, there is a 90% chance that the classifier is actually telling the adversary to interfere with an unrelated traffic stream, and only a 10% chance that the classifier was actually correct.</p>\n<p>This phenomenon was <a href=\"http://www.raid-symposium.org/raid99/PAPERS/Axelsson.pdf\">explored in detail</a> in the Intrusion Detection System literature, and is the reason why anomaly and classification-based antivirus and IDS systems have failed to materialize in the marketplace (despite early success in academic literature).</p>\n<h2>Practical Issues: Multipliers of World Size are Common</h2>\n<p>Beyond the above issues, there are a number of additional sources of world size and complexity in the website traffic fingerprinting problem domain that are completely unaddressed by the literature.</p>\n<p>Again, it is important to remember that despite the use of the word \"website\" in their titles, these attacks operate on classifying instances of traffic patterns created by single  <b><i>pages</i></b>, and not entire <b><i>sites</i></b>. For some sites, there may be little difference between one page and another. For many sites, the difference between component pages is significant.</p>\n<p>It is also important to note that the total number of pages on the web is actually quite larger than the number of items indexed by Google (which is quite a bit larger than even the 1,000,000 page crawl used by Panchenko). In particular, the effects of dynamically generated pages, unindexed pages, rapidly updated pages, interactive pages, and authenticated webapps have been neglected in these studies, and their various possible traffic patterns contribute a very large number of additional web traffic patterns to the world, especially when the different manners in which users interact with them are taken into account.</p>\n<p>Beyond this, each page actually also has at least 8 different common traffic patterns consisting of the combination of the following common browser configurations: Cached vs non-cached; Javascript enabled vs disabled; adblocked vs non-adblocked. In each of these combinations, different component resources are loaded for a given page. In fact, the cached vs non-cached property is not just binary: arbitrary combinations of content elements on any given page may be cached by the browser from a previous visit to a related resource. What's more, in Tor Browser, either restarting the browser or using the \"New Identity\" button causes all of this caching state to be reset.</p>\n<p>In addition, similarities between non-web and web traffic also complicate the problem domain. For just one example, it is likely that an open tab with a Twitter query in it generates similar traffic patterns to a Tor-enabled XMPP or IRC client.</p>\n<p>All of these factors increase the complexity of the hypothesis space and the instance space, which as we demonstrated above, will necessarily reduce the accuracy of the attack in both theory and practice.</p>\n<h2>Literature Review: Andriy Panchenko et al</h2>\n<p>Title: <b><a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/wpes11-panchenko.pdf\">Website Fingerprinting in Onion Routing Based Anonymization Networks</a></b></p>\n<p>As mentioned previously, Panchenko's work (actually the first work to successfully apply website traffic fingerprinting to Tor) is still the most comprehensive study to date.</p>\n<p>Here is a brief list of its strengths:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The world sizes are huge.\n<p>5000 page subsets of 1,000,000 pages may still have representational issues compared to the real world, but this is still the largest study to date.</p>\n<li>Careful feature extraction (hypothesis space construction).\n<p>The reason why this work succeeded where earlier works failed is because rather than simply toss raw data into a machine learning algorithm, they were extremely careful with the representation of data for their classifiers. This likely enabled both the efficiency that allowed such a large world size, and reduced the bias in the hypothesis space that would otherwise lead to low accuracy and high false positives at such large world sizes.\n </li>\n<li>In the \"open world\", they varied the type of censored target sites to evaluate accuracy.\n<p>Instead of merely picking the target pages that were easiest to classify (such as video sites), they varied the type of target pages and explored the effects on both true and false positive accuracy. None of the other literature to date has examined this effect in detail.</p>\n<li>They are careful to tune their classifiers to minimize false positives.\n<p>Modern classifiers typically allow you to trade off between false positives and false negatives. Given how deeply false positives impact the adversary's goals, this is very important.</p>\n<li>They demonstrate knowledge of all of the factors involved in PAC theory and practical classifier accuracy.\n<p>All of the other papers to date simply omit one or more of the following: data on feature extraction, the contribution of individual features to accuracy, the number of training examples, the effect of target size on both the open and closed world, the effect of target page types on accuracy, and the effects of world size on accuracy.\n</ol>\n<p>While impressive, it does miss a few details:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It fails to acknowledge that false positives are a property of specific sites.\n<p>In reality, nearly every false positive they experienced in a given subset of 5000 pages is a false positive that will likely appear in a classifier that is run against the entire 1,000,000 page dataset. They probably should have tallied the total false positives over multiple runs for this reason, and analyzed their properties.</p>\n<li>It still fails to provide a realistic adversary model in order to justify claims that the attack actually accomplishes what the adversary wants.\n</ol>\n<h2>Literature Review: Kevin P. Dyer et al</h2>\n<p>Title: <b><a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/oakland2012-peekaboo.pdf\">Peek-a-Boo, I Still See You: Why Efficient Traffic Analysis Countermeasures Fail</a></b></p>\n<p>This work attempts to evaluate several defenses against the website traffic fingerprinting attack, and also attempts to evaluate an \"idealized best case\" defense called BuFLO.</p>\n<p>On the positive side, the work makes the following contributions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It creates an ideal high-overhead tunable defense (BuFLO) that can be compared against other practical defenses.\n<li>It is quite clear about its definitions of accuracy and experimental setup.\n<li><a href=\"https://kpdyer.com/publications/oakland2012-peekaboo-0.1.tar.gz\">Source code is provided</a>!\n</ol>\n<p><br>However, the work had the following rather serious shortcomings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Close world only, and a very small closed world at that.\n<p>This is the single largest issue with this attack paper. You cannot claim that all defenses are broken forever if a classifier is only able to somewhat correctly classify 500 pages or less (and only 128 pages in their defense studies!), even in a closed world.</p>\n<li>Exaggerated claims give no credit to (or detailed analysis of) relative strengths of defenses.\n<p>Despite the fact that their exaggerated claims are made possible due to their small world size of only 128 pages, the authors do not acknowledge that some light weight defenses <b>did</b> in fact do far better than others in their experiments. In light of the fact that their world size was woefully small, the authors work would have been substantially more humble in terms of acknowledging the effectiveness of some defenses, and should have spent more time focusing on why some defenses did better against some classifiers, what the overhead costs were, and what classifier features were most impacted by each defense.</p>\n<li>It does not give statistics on which sites suffer high rates of misclassification.\n<p>Even in their small world size, is it likely that they stumbled upon a few pages that ended up consistently misclassified. Which were these? How often does that happen out of arbitrary 128 page subsets?</p>\n<li>Features are evaluated, but not in terms of their contribution to accuracy.\n<p>There are several standard ways of evaluating the contribution of features to accuracy under various conditions. The authors appeared to employ none of them.\n</ol>\n<h2>Literature Review: Xiang Cai et al</h2>\n<p>Title: <b><a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/ccs2012-fingerprinting.pdf\">Touching from a Distance: Website Fingerprinting Attacks and Defenses</a></b></p>\n<p>This work also attempts to evaluate several additional defenses against the website traffic fingerprinting attack, proposes a Hidden Markov Model extension of the attack to classify web sites in addition to pages, and also attempts to evaluate the BuFLO defense from the \"Peek-a-boo\" paper, as well as a lower-overhead variant.</p>\n<p>On the positive side, the following useful contributions were made:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A low-resource \"congestion sensitive\" version of Dyer et al's BuFLO defense is presented.\n<p>This defense is also tunable, and deserves a more fair evaluation than was given to it by its own creators. Hopefully they will follow up on it.</p>\n<li>An automatic feature extraction mechanism is built in to the classifier.\n<p>The work uses an edit distance algorithm to automatically extract features (pairwise transposition, insertion, deletions and substitutions) rather than manual specification and extraction.\n</ol>\n<p>However, this paper also shares many of the Peek-a-boo paper's shortcomings above, and has some of its own.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Minimal edit distance classifiers are ideally suited for a closed world.\n<p>The DLSVM classifier finds the shortest edit distance between a single testing instance and the model instances from training. This is a useful heuristic for a closed world, where you know that your training instance will match *something* from your model, but how well does it fare when you have to tune a cutoff to decide when a given traffic stream's edit distance is too large to be among your censored target pages? It seems likely that it is still better than Panchenko's classifier in the open world, but this has not been proven conclusively, especially since the effect of site uniqueness on the classifier was not examined.</p>\n<li>Glosses over effects of defenses on edit distance components.\n<p>Even though edit distance classifiers do not have explicit features, they still have implicit ones. It would be useful to study the effect of low-resource defenses on the most information-heavy components of the edit distances. Or better: to analyze how to tailor their BuFLO variant to target these components in an optimal way.</p>\n<li>Defenses were not given a fair analysis.\n<p>In the specific case of both Tor Browser's pipeline defense and <a href=\" <a href=\">HTTPOS</a>, an analysis of the actual prevalence of pipelining and server side support for the HTTPOS feature set was not performed. Nor were statistics on actual request combination and reordering given, nor were the effects on the feature components analyzed.</p>\n<li>Navigation-based Hidden Markov Models are user-specific, and will also suffer from Garbage-In Garbage-Out false positive properties.\n<p>While a Hidden Markov Model would appear to provide increased accuracy by being able to utilize multiple observations, the reality of web usage is that users' navigation patterns are not uniform and will vary by individual and social group, especially for news/portal sites and for social networks. For example, people often navigate off of Twitter to view outside links, and some people share more links than others. It is quite likely that the HMM will consider any link portal (or any repetitive background network activity) that has an occasional false positive match for Twitter to be mistaken for such intermittent Twitter usage.\n</ol>\n<h2>Literature Review: Tao Wang and Ian Goldberg</h2>\n<p>Title: <b><a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/wpes13-fingerprinting.pdf\">Improved Website Fingerprinting on Tor</a></b></p>\n<p>This paper improves upon the work by Cai et al by statistically removing Tor flow control cells, improving the training performance of the classifier, and by performing a small-scale open world study of edit distance based classifiers. It also provides some limited analysis of difficult to classify sites.</p>\n<p>The paper has the following issues:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A broken implementation of Tor Browser's defense was studied, despite warnings to the contrary.\n<p>Last year, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8470\">we discovered serious issues</a> with the HTTP Pipeline randomization defense that were introduced during the transition from Firefox 4 to Firefox 10, and that other issues may have been present in the Firefox 4 version as well. These issues were corrected during the transition to Firefox 17, and the pipeline randomization defense was vastly improved, but the authors still chose to evaluate the broken version, despite our offers for assistance. Moreover, like previous work, an analysis of the actual prevalence of server-side pipelining support and request combination and reordering was not performed.</p>\n<li>Small world size.\n<p>This paper studies a smaller closed world size than the previous edit distance based work (100 pages instead of 1000), and uses only 1000 pages for its open world study.</p>\n<li>Target site types were not varied in the open world.\n<p>Unlike Panchenko's work, the types of sites chosen as censored targets were fixed, not varied. This makes it hard to evaluate the effects of types of sites with either very distinct or more typical traffic patterns on the accuracy of their classifier.\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~t55wang/\">Source code is provided</a>, however, so it may be possible to revisit and correct some of these issues, at least.</p>\n<h2>Concluding Remarks: Suggestions for Future Work</h2>\n<p>This post is not meant to dismiss the website traffic fingerprinting attack entirely. It is merely meant to point out that defense work has not been as conclusively studied as these papers have claimed, and that defenses are actually easier than is presently assumed by the current body of literature.</p>\n<p>We believe that the theoretical and practical issues enumerated in this post demonstrate that defenses do not need to be terribly heavy-weight to be effective. It is likely that in practice, relatively simple defenses will still substantially increase the false positive rate of this attack when it is performed against large numbers of web pages (and non-web background traffic), against large volumes of Tor-like traffic, against large numbers of users, or any combination thereof.</p>\n<p>We therefore encourage a re-evaluation of existing defenses such as <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/LZCLCP_NDSS11.pdf\">HTTPOS</a>, SPDY and pipeline randomization, and <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7028\">Guard node adaptive padding</a>, <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/morphing09.pdf\">Traffic Morphing</a>, as well as the development of additional defenses.</p>\n<p>It is possible that some types of pages (especially those on video sites, file locker sites, and sites with very large content elements) may make natural false posties rare, especially when classified among smaller, more typical pages. For instance, it is unlikely to be possible to generate false positives when the classifier needs only to distinguish between pages from Wikipedia versus Youtube, but it is likely that generic large content and video downloads can be obfuscated such that it is hard to recognize the specific video or download site with minimal relative overhead.</p>\n<p>As in the work done by Panchenko, we also suggest evaluating each of your classifier's explicit or implicit features for their <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection\">relative contribution to overall accuracy</a> (especially among similar classes of sites) as this will help guide the padding and obfuscation behaviors of any defenses you or others might devise. The high-information component features or edit distances can be analyzed and used as input to a statistically adaptive padding defense, for example.</p>\n<p>In any event, please do contact us if you're interested in studying these or other defenses in Tor Browser or Tor itself.</p>\n<p>If you are not interested in helping improve the defenses of Tor, do not have time to perform such evaluations in a thorough manner, or have already previously published a website traffic fingerprinting attack paper yourself, we request that you publish or at least provide us with the source code and  the data sets involved in your attack, so that we or others can reproduce your results and evaluate potential defenses as well.</p>\n<h2>Concluding Remarks: Dual Purpose Defenses</h2>\n<p>It turns out that some defenses against the website traffic fingerprinting attack are also useful against the end-to-end correlation attack. In particular, defenses that increase the rate of false positives of website traffic fingerprinting using padding and other one-ended schemes is very likely to increase the rate of false positives for end-to-end correlation, especially under situations where either limited record-keeping capacity, sample-based analysis, or link-level encryption reduce connection and inter-packet timing information.</p>\n<p>If a defense introduces false positive between many different web pages in website traffic fingerprinting by manipulating the traffic patterns at the entrance of the Tor network but not the exit, it will be very likely to introduce false positives during correlation between the entrance and exit traffic of simultaneous downloads of these same pages. As in website traffic fingerprinting, it turns out that even a small amount of false positives will <a href=\"http://archives.seul.org/or/dev/Sep-2008/msg00016.html\">frustrate a dragnet adversary attempting end-to-end correlation</a>.</p>\n<p>End-to-end correlation is a much more difficult problem, and we may not ever solve the problem of repeated observations. However, we likely can increase the number and duration of successful observations that correlation attacks will require to build high confidence, especially if the user base grows very large, and if the web moves to higher adoption rates of TLS (so that HTTP identifiers are not available to provide long-term linkability at exit nodes).</p>\n<p>Promising defenses include <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7028\">Adaptive Padding</a>, <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/morphing09.pdf\">Traffic Morphing</a>, and various <a href=\"http://dev.online6.eu/spdytor/\">transformation and prediction proxies</a> at the exit node (which could also help performance while we're at it).</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the twentieth issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>First beta release of Tor Browser Bundle 3.0</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html\">Tor Browser Bundle</a> is the Tor Project’s flagship product: an easy and straightforward way to browse the web with anonymity and privacy.</p>\n<p>With previous Tor Browser Bundles, users had to interact with two different applications, Vidalia and the browser itself. Vidalia was responsible for handling and configuring the tor daemon, and the browser had no knowledge of the connection status and other details.  The result was confusing error messages, and mismatched user expectations.</p>\n<p>With the 3.0 series of Tor Browser Bundle, the browser is directly responsible for configuring and handling the tor daemon. Users only see one single application. It’s clearer that only the browser will go through the Tor network. Starting and stopping the browser will take care of starting and stopping tor — no extra steps are required.</p>\n<p>Mike Perry, Kathleen Brade, Mark Smith, Georg Koppen, among others, are working hard to perfect many other usability and technical improvements that are part of Tor Browser Bundle 3.0 which has now reached the “beta” stage.</p>\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30beta1-released\">3.0beta1 release</a> is based on Firefox 17.0.10esr for <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox17.0.10\">security updates</a>, and contains several other small improvements and corrections.</p>\n<p>Current users of the 3.0 alpha series should update. Others should <a href=\"https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/3.0b1/\">give it a try</a>!</p>\n<h1>A critique of website traffic fingerprinting attacks</h1>\n<p>For a new <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/critique-website-traffic-fingerprinting-attacks\">blog post</a>, Mike Perry took the time to reflect on fingerprinting attacks on website traffic. These are attacks “where the adversary attempts to recognize the encrypted traffic patterns of specific web pages without using any other information. In the case of Tor, this attack would take place between the user and the Guard node, or at the Guard node itself.”</p>\n<p>In the post, Mike lays down three distinct types of adversary that could mount fingerprinting attacks: partial blocking of Tor, identification of visitors of a set of targeted pages, and identification of all web pages visited by a user.</p>\n<p>In theory, such attacks could pose devastating threats to Tor users.  But in practice, “false positives matter” together with other factors that affect the classification accuracy. Mike gives a comprehensive introduction to these issues before reviewing five research papers published between 2011 and 2013. Each of them are summarized together with their shortcomings.</p>\n<p>Mike concludes that “defense work has not been as conclusively studied as these papers have claimed, and that defenses are actually easier than is presently assumed by the current body of literature.” He encourages researchers to re-evaluate existing defenses “such as <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/LZCLCP_NDSS11.pdf\">HTTPOS</a>, SPDY and pipeline randomization, <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/7028\">Guard node adaptive padding</a>, and <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/morphing09.pdf\">Traffic Morphing</a>“, and to think about “the development of additional defenses”. Mike ends his post by mentioning that some new defenses can also be dual purpose and help with end-to-end correlation attacks.</p>\n<h1>The “bananaphone” pluggable transport</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html\">Pluggable transports</a> is how Tor traffic can be transformed from a<br />\nclient to a bridge in order to hide it from Deep Packet Inspection filters.</p>\n<p>Improving upon the <a href=\"https://github.com/leif/bananaphone\">initial work of Leif Ryge</a>, David Stainton has been working on the new <a href=\"https://github.com/david415/obfsproxy/tree/david-bananaphone\">“bananaphone” pluggable transport for obfsproxy</a>. The latter implements “reverse hash encoding“, described by Leif Ryge as “a steganographic encoding scheme which transforms a stream of binary data into a stream of tokens (e.g., something resembling natural language text) such that the stream can be decoded by concatenating the hashes of the tokens.”</p>\n<p>For a concrete example, that means that using <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/29468/pg29468.txt\">Project Gutenberg’s Don Quixote</a> as corpus, one can encode “my little poney” into “lock whisper: yellow tremendous, again suddenly breathing. master’s faces; fees, beheld convinced there calm” and back again!</p>\n<p>While it’s probably not going to be the most compact pluggable transport, “bananaphone” looks like a promising project.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Christian Grothoff, Matthias Wachs and Hellekin Wolf are working on getting <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005747.html\">special-use domain names for P2P networks reserved</a> according to <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761\">RFC 6761</a>: “the goal is to reserve .onion, .exit, .i2p, .gnu and .zkey (so that they don’t become ordinary commercial TLDs at some point)”.</p>\n<p>The Tails team has released their report on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-November/000383.html\">Tails activity during the month of October</a>. Things are happening on many fronts, have a look!</p>\n<p>Andrea Shepard has been working on new scheduler code for Tor. Its goal is to remove the limitation that “we can only see one channel at a time when making scheduling decisions.” Balancing between circuits without opening new attack vectors is tricky, Andrea is asking for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005761.html\">comments on potential heuristics</a>.</p>\n<p>Justin Findlay has <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005762.html\">recreated some of the website diagrams</a> in the versatile SVG format.</p>\n<p>Roger <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031001.html\">asked the community</a> to create a “Tor, king of anonymity” graphic for his presentations. Griffin Boyce made a <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/PmuFz4n.jpg\">“queen of anonymity” picture</a>, Lazlo Westerhof <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/vYZSu6Q.png\">crowned the onion</a> and Matt Pagan did the <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/2yIMmcQ.png\">full Tor logo</a> .</p>\n<p>David Fifield released the new <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/pluggable-transports-bundles-2417-rc-1-pt2-firefox-17010esr\">Pluggable Transports Tor Browser Bundle version 2.4.17-rc-1-pt2 </a> based on Tor Browser Bundle 2.4.17-rc-1. The only change from the previous release of the pluggable transport bundle is a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10030#comment:20\">workaround</a> that makes transports resume working on Mac OS X Mavericks.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk round-up</h1>\n<p>Recently users have been writing the help desk asking for assistance verifying the signature on their Tor Browser Bundle package. These users said they found the <a href=\"https://torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html\">instructions on the official Tor Project page</a> confusing. One person reported being unsure of how to open a terminal on their computer. Another person did not know how to save the package signature onto the Desktop. Yet another person reported they were able to verify the signature only after discovering that their GnuPG program was named gpg2.exe rather than gpg.exe. A ticket on <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10073\">improving the signature verification page</a> has been opened.</p>\n<p>One user mentioned wanting to use the Tor Browser Bundle as their default browser but being unable to do so because their online bank required Java. Java is disabled in the Tor Browser Bundle because it can bypass the browser proxy settings and leak the client’s real IP address over the network.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, dope457, David Stainton, sqrt2, and Roger Dingledine.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the twenty-first issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news/\">weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>tor 0.2.4.18-rc is out</h1>\n<p>On the 16th of November, Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031110.html\">released the fourth release candidate for the tor 0.2.4.x series </a>. As Roger puts it: “It takes a variety of fixes from the 0.2.5.x branch to improve stability, performance, and better handling of edge cases.” Readers curious for more details can look at the announcement for the complete list of changes.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">source is available</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html#development\">updated Debian packages</a>. All relay operators should upgrade. Updated Tor Browser Bundles are in the making and should be available shortly.</p>\n<h1>USB Sticks for Tails</h1>\n<p>It is often recommended to run Tails from a read-only medium in order to prevent any malware to permanently mess with the system. “CD is best, but many devices these days don’t have an optical drive, and handling CDs is not as convenient as a USB stick” <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031092.html\">wrote Moritz Bartl on tor-talk</a>.</p>\n<p>It looks like one of the very few specific brand of USB sticks available in Germany that had a proper hardware protection switch can no longer be used to boot Tails. Moritz ended up contacting various Chinese suppliers. “Even there, the selection of sticks with write protection is very limited” but eventually one model was found acceptable. Moritz intend to re-sell a bulk of them at the <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/\">upcoming 30C3 in Hamburg</a>.</p>\n<p>Feel free to join the discussion or contact Moritz privately for more details.</p>\n<h1>New version of check.torproject.org</h1>\n<p>On the 15th of November, regular users of the Tor Browser Bundle have probably noticed a change in their preferred welcome page. Andrew Lewman had just <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031126.html\">switched check.torproject.org to a new version</a> <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9529\">written by Arlo Breault in Go</a>. The <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/check.git\">new codebase</a> should allow the service to better handle the increasingly high number of connections. <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=closed&amp;changetime=2013-11-15..&amp;component=Tor+Check\">Several fixes</a> were also made during the reimplementation regarding wording, translations and other meaningful details.</p>\n<p>Please report any issues you encounter to the “Tor Check” component of the Tor bug tracker.</p>\n<h1>Current state of the proposals</h1>\n<p>In 2007, Tor developers settled on a <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/001-process.txt\">formal process</a> for changes in Tor specifications or other major changes. At this heart of this process in the “proposal” documents that are discussed on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-dev\">tor-dev mailing list</a> and archived in the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/HEAD:/proposals\">“torspec” Git repository</a>.</p>\n<p>Last week, Nick Mathewson took a closer look at what have changed since the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2012-June/003641.html\">last round up</a> he did in June last year. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005797.html\">Since then</a>, 16 proposals has been implemented in tor 0.2.3, 0.2.4 and 0.2.5 and two have been superseded or deemed unhelpful.</p>\n<p>Nick subsequently <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005798.html\">posted</a> a review of all “open”, “needs-revision”, and “needs-research” proposals. They are many different tasks to be picked by someone who wishes to help Tor in these 42 proposals, be it by doing research, code, leading discussions or more in-depth analysis.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Radu Rădeanu came up with a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9353#comment:38\">workaround</a> for Tor users on Ubuntu 13.10 which temporarily fixes keyboard bug in 64-bit Tor Browser Bundles when used in combination with IBus.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031134.html\">called for help</a> in the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10182\">collection</a> of the new Tor related articles in the press. “According to <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/press/press\">the website</a> the last time there was a meaningful article about Tor was July 1st. This is very far from the case.” If you want to help, just <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorArticles\">edit the wiki page</a>.</p>\n<p>Firefox 24 is soon going to replace version 17 as “stable” supported release by Mozilla. intrigeri has <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-November/004165.html\">completed his work</a> in updating Tails’ browser to the point where it “is good enough for Tails 0.22”. Builds from the “feature/ff24” are available <a href=\"http://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_feature-ff24/\"></a> for wider testing.</p>\n<p>Andreas Jonsson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031111.html\">released</a> initial sandboxed version of the TBB 3.0 series which is <a href=\"https://github.com/trams242/tor-browser-bundle\">ready for testing</a>. This security feature should prevent an exploit from stealing user data : the Tor Browser will not be allowed to execute any programs, nor will it be allowed to read or modify data on disk except in the users “downloads”-folder and its own profile. The sandbox is currently only supported on OS X 10.9 “but making it work all the way down to 10.6 is not unlikely”.</p>\n<p>Check Mike Perry’s <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-November/000384.html\">latest report</a> to see what he has been up to in October.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Users have asked the help desk for support connecting to IRC through Tor. There are some guides on sending IRC traffic through Tor on the wiki (<a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/InstantMessaging\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/IrcSilc\">2</a>). Tails also comes with <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/anonymous_internet/pidgin/\">Pidgin preconfigured for IRC</a>. However, it will not matter if the IRC client is correctly configured if the if the intended IRC network blocks all Tor users. For example, users trying to connect to synIRC through Tor will receive a message telling them their computer is part of a botnet.</p>\n<p>Users will occasionally ask for support using Tor on ChromeOS. ChromeOS is based on Linux, so it is theoretically possible to run the Linux Tor Browser Bundle on ChromeOS. In practice, the Chromebook prevents users from executing new software on their computers without putting their Chromebook into developer mode, and <a href=\"http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/chromiumos-design-docs/security-overview\">making other modifications to their device</a>. Anyone who has successfully run the Tor Browser Bundle on ChromeOS is invited to describe their experiences on the Tor Project wiki. As of this writing, there is no documented way of running Tor Browser Bundle on ChromeOS.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, dope457, Matt Pagan, and Andreas Jonsson.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

The <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-tor-browser-bundles-firefox-17011esr-and-tor-02418-rc\">stable version of the Tor Browser Bundle has been updated</a> accordingly. The 2.4 release candidate also received an update, together with the latest incarnation of tor 0.2.4.18-rc. Both were then given <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/64-bit-gnulinux-tor-browser-bundles-updated\">a further update</a> due to an issue on 64 bit GNU/Linux systems.</p>\n<p>The 3.0 branch saw the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-30rc1-released\">release of 3.0rc1</a> which — on top of updating its base software — fixed a build reproducibility issue on Windows, and a few other small fixes.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-November/004152.html\">updated version of Tails</a> and the pluggable transport bundle are still in the making at the time of writing.</p>\n<h1>Tor is looking for a Browser Hacker and an Extension Developer!</h1>\n<p>Mike Perry <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-looking-browser-hacker-and-extension-developer\">wrote a blog post</a> to announce two new positions available at the Tor Project: “We are looking for a <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-browserhacker.html\">C++ browser developer</a> to work on our Firefox-based browser, and a <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/jobs-extdev.html.en\">Firefox extension developer</a> to work on our growing number of Firefox extensions. Our ideal candidates would be comfortable in both roles, but we are also interested in hearing from people with either skillset.”</p>\n<p>Look at the job descriptions for more details and how to apply for these exciting opportunities to make Tor software even better.</p>\n<h1>“Safeplug”</h1>\n<p>Roman Mamedov <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031199.html\">reported</a> that the Californian company Cloud Engines is now shipping a device called the “Safeplug”. Exactly how the device works is unclear, but according to their FAQ, it looks like a router which transparently directs its client connections through Tor.</p>\n<p>Such an approach is known to be flawed. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031200.html\">Sean Alexandre</a> was prompt in reminding everyone that “application protocols can still reveal your identity”, and quoted the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html#warning\">warning on Tor’s download page</a>: “To avoid problems with Tor configuration, we strongly recommend you use the Tor Browser Bundle. It is pre-configured to protect your privacy and anonymity on the web as long as you’re browsing with the Tor Browser itself. Almost any other web browser configuration is likely to be unsafe to use with Tor.”</p>\n<p>Aaron Gibson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031215.html\">detailed other concerns</a>, namely the absence of source code or design documents, the mandatory router registration procedure, issues with the automatic update system, and the terms of service. He also criticized the “torified everything” approach and outlined an alternative which he had discussed with Roger Dingledine: “providing a captive portal that would instruct a user to download a copy of TBB and use the local router device as a first hop into the Tor network, perhaps by configuring the device as a bridge.”</p>\n<p>On the upside, Andrew Lewman <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031204.html\">views the product</a> as “a fine test case for consumer-level torouter market analysis. It would be great to learn 6 months from now how many they sold and a summary of customer feedback.” Despite having “<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-November/031235.html\">lots of concerns</a>”, Andrew is “trying to discuss them with Cloud Engines” and praised the community for “doing a fine job of raising questions”.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005836.html\">gave the number 223</a> to Esfandiar Mohammadi’s proposal titled “<a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/223-ace-handshake.txt\">Ace: Improved circuit-creation key exchange</a>”.</p>\n<p>Matt Pagan <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-November/000385.html\">reported </a> on his trip to Washington, D.C., USA for the Rally Against Mass Surveillance. He gave an account of his talk during the cryptoparty and the march that happened the next day.</p>\n<p>Arturo Filastò sent his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-November/000386.html\">report</a> about his activities in October.</p>\n<p>Nathan Freitas reported on his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005857.html\">efforts to use GeckoView on Android 4.4</a>, which can be seen as the “first step towards Tor Browser on Android”.</p>\n<p>Kevin Dyer <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005861.html\">announced</a> a new release of a <a href=\"https://fteproxy.org/\">pluggable transport powered by Format-Transforming Encryption</a>. Cross-platform builds of the pluggable transport Tor Browser Bundle are available for download for the adventurous.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Echoing the tor-talk thread summarized above, multiple people asked whether or not the Tor Project could recommend the Safeplug device.</p>\n<p>An OS X user asked if it was always necessary to open the Tor Browser folder in order to start the Tor Browser Bundle.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the twenty-third issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Next-Generation Hidden Services reach draft proposal state</h1>\n<p>Nick Mathewson has been working on turning a “revamp of the hidden services protocol” into a <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/001-process.txt\">formal proposal</a>. Last Saturday, Nick blessed the tor-dev mailing list with a post of the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005877.html\">current draft for proposal 224</a>, dubbed “Next-Generation Hidden Services in Tor”.</p>\n<p>Nick currently lists 25 different people who made writing the new proposal possible, and there will be probably some more to add before the proposal reaches completion. We will spare the reader a full list, but <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/tor-weekly-news\">Tor Weekly News’ archives</a> attest that George Kadianakis deserves a special mention for his repeated efforts to move things forward.</p>\n<p>The proposal aims to replace “the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/rend-spec.txt\">current rend-spec.txt</a>, rewritten for clarity and for improved design.” The most user visible change from the current hidden services protocol is the new address format. In order to prevent the enumeration of hidden services, the new protocol derives a “blinded key” (section 1.3) from an Ed25519 master identity key. The blinding operation operates on the full key (and not just a truncated hash, as before). With a base 32 encoding of the entire 256 bits (section 1.2), “a new name following this specification might look like: <code>a1uik0w1gmfq3i5ievxdm9ceu27e88g6o7pe0rffdw9jmntwkdsd.onion</code>”. Other encodings might still be worth consideration as long as they make valid hostnames.</p>\n<p>Less visible changes include the departure from RSA1024, DH1024, and SHA1 to prefer Ed25519, Curve25519, and SHA256 as the cryptographic primitives (section 0.3).</p>\n<p>The selection of directories responsible for a hidden service will now depend on a periodic “collaboratively generated random value” provided by the Tor directory authorities. This way the directories of a hidden service are not predictable in advance, which prevents targeted denial of service attacks (see <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/8244\">ticket #8244</a> and <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/225-strawman-shared-rand.txt\">proposal 225</a> for a possible scheme).</p>\n<p>The new proposal also introduces the possibility of keeping the master identity key offline (section 1.7).</p>\n<p>The proposal is completely unfinished when it comes to scaling hidden services to multiple hosts (section 1.5). There have been <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005556.html\">discussions on this topic</a>, but there is no final decision on what the final scheme should be. The problem with naive scaling schemes is that information about the number of hidden service nodes can leak to adversarial clients or introduction points.</p>\n<p>In order to move the proposal forward from the current draft, Nick Mathewson told the readers: “I’d like to know what doesn’t make sense, what I need to explain better, and what I need to design better. I’d like to fill in the gaps and turn this into a more full document. I’d like to answer the open questions. Comments are most welcome, especially if they grow into improvements.” The document is still sprinkled with many TODO items, so feel free to jump in if you want to help!</p>\n<h1>Tor relay operators meeting at 30C3</h1>\n<p>Moritz Bartl <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-December/003449.html\">announced</a> that a meeting of Tor relay operators and organizations will be held as part of the first day of the 30th Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg on the 27th December. He asked major relay operators and Torservers.net partner organizations to prepare some slides explaining their activities; the German partner organization, Zwiebelfreunde e.V., will hold its own meeting directly afterwards.</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for November 2013</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of November has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-November/000387.html\">Pearl Crescent</a> released their report first </a>, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000388.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000389.html\">Lunar</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000390.html\">Colin C.</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000391.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000393.html\">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000394.html\">Arlo Breault</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2013-December/000395.html\">Ximin Luo</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/test_0.22-rc1/\">first release candidate for Tails 0.22</a> is out.

Nathan Freitas is <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-November/005884.html\">looking for comment</a> from the community as he is “thinking about having Orbot use it by default, and then offering ARM and x86 binaries as add-on enhancements.” His main argument is that it “would make the core Tor on Android experience more lightweight for client only use.”</p>\n<p>The Electronic Frontier Foundation helped a student group in Iowa convince their university that they should be allowed to hold discussions about Tor on campus. The EFF’s <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/12/open-letter-urging-universities-encourage-conversation-about-online-privacy\">open letter to universities</a> and their <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/tor-myths-and-facts\">“Myths and Facts About Tor”</a> document make useful advocacy material.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Multiple users asked about using Tor for PC gaming. Tor can only transport TCP, which is how web pages are transmitted. Many video games rely on UDP or other protocols to transport data because of the lower latency. Information these games transport over protocols besides TCP would not be sent over Tor. Also any software used with Tor needs to be tested for proxy obedience. Untested applications might send information without using Tor even if they appear to be configured correctly, and<br />\nwithout the user realizing it.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, harmony, Matt Pagan, dope457, George Kadianakis, Nick Mathewson, sqrt2 and Roger Dingledine.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

The campaign is gathering funds for Tor core development work, the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/\">Tails live system</a>, the encrypted mobile communication tools <a href=\"https://whispersystems.org/\">RedPhone and TextSecure</a>, and the encrypted email platform <a href=\"https://leap.se/\">LEAP</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/\">Spread the word</a> and help make the campaign a success.

You can consult the full changelog in Roger’s announcement, and <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">download the source code</a> from the website.</p>\n<p>As no code changes have been made since the previous release candidate, there is no reasons for users of tor 0.2.4.18-rc to upgrade in a hurry.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser Bundle 3.5rc1 is out</h1>\n<p>Mike Perry <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-35rc1-released\">announced</a> the first release candidate in the Tor Browser Bundle 3.5 series, and strongly encouraged users to update in anticipation of the imminent end-of-life of both the 2.x stable and 3.0 series, following Mozilla's deprecation of Firefox 17 ESR, on which both are based.</p>\n<p>This release also includes a number of important security updates, alongside various bugfixes and usability improvements; for this reason as well, users should upgrade as soon as possible.</p>\n<h1>Tails 0.22 is out</h1>\n<p>Tails saw its <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.22/\">35th release</a> on December 11th. It incorporates many major and minor improvements and bugfixes, and opens up the new incremental-upgrade feature for beta-testing.</p>\n<p>As this is the first release to feature a browser based on the Firefox 24 ESR series, some small inconveniences found their way in. Have a look at the known issues before giving it a go.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, it fixes <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.21/\">several important security issues</a>, so it is recommended that all users upgrade as soon as possible.</p>\n<h1>Torservers.net awarded $250,000 grant</h1>\n<p>The Torservers.net team <a href=\"https://blog.torservers.net/20131213/torservers-awarded-250000-by-digital-defenders.html\">announced</a> that they have received a $250,000 organizational grant, to be spread over two years, from the <a href=\"http://digitaldefenders.org/\">Digital Defenders Partnership</a>, which in its own words was “established to provide rapid response to threats to internet freedom.”</p>\n<p>With this grant, wrote Moritz Bartl, “participating Torservers organizations will be able to sustain at least 3 Gbit/s of exit traffic, and 2000 fast and up-to-date bridges.”</p>\n<p>In order to make the most efficient use of this significant contribution to the Tor network while maintaining its diversity, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2013-December/003495.html\">wrote Moritz</a>, “we need to find seven more organizations that are willing to rent servers for a period of at least 2 years”, <a href=\"https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/liberationtech/2013-December/012376.html\">adding</a> that “we really want to avoid having organizations run both high bandwidth exit relays and a larger number of Tor bridges: An operator should not see both traffic entering the Tor network and traffic leaving the Tor network” .</p>\n<p>For this reason, he called for groups interested in supporting the Tor network to get in contact, in order to discuss how they can best set up and maintain Tor services. The first such partnership will be with the <a href=\"https://www.cyber-arabs.com/\">Institute for War and Peace Reporting's Cyber Arabs group</a>.</p>\n<p>If you represent an organization that could make this much-needed contribution to the Tor network, please contact the Torservers.net team, or join them at the <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Session:Torservers_Meetup\">Tor relay operators meetup during the upcoming Chaos Communication Congress in Hamburg</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>The Tails team reported on the vast amount of <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2013_11/\">activity that occurred during November 2013</a>.

See inline and see the FAQ link for more details.</p>\n<p>The 2.x stable series of the Tor Browser Bundle has officially been deprecated, and all users are encouraged to upgrade to the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/tbb-35\">3.5 series</a>.</p>\n<p>Packages are now available from the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html\">Tor download page</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://archive.torproject.org/tor-package-archive/torbrowser/3.5/\">Tor Package archive</a>.</p>\n<p>For now, the Pluggable Transports-capable TBB is still a separate package, maintained by David Fifield. Download them here: <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/pt-bundle/3.5-pt20131217/\">https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/pt-bundle/3.5-pt20131217/</a>. We hope to have combined packages available in a beta soon.</p>\n<p>For people already using TBB 3.5rc1, the changes are not substantial, and are included below.</p>\n<p>However, for users of TBB 2.x and 3.0, this release includes <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.2\">important security updates to Firefox</a>. All users are strongly encouraged to update immediately, as we will not be making further releases in the 2.x or 3.0 series.</p>\n<p>In terms of user-facing changes from TBB 2.x, the 3.x series primarily features the replacement of Vidalia with a Firefox-based Tor controller called Tor Launcher. This has resulted in a vast decrease in startup times, and a vast increase in usability. We have also begun work on an <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBrowserBundle3FAQ\">FAQ page</a> to handle common questions arising from this transition -- where Vidalia went, how to disable JavaScript, how to check signatures, etc.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/Bundle-Data/Docs/ChangeLog.txt\">complete changelog</a> for the 3.x series describes the changes since 2.x.</p>\n<p>The set of changes since the 3.5rc1 release is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All Platforms\n<ul>\n<li>Update Tor to 0.2.4.19\n<li>Update Tor Launcher to 0.2.4.2\n<ul>\n<li>Bug 10382: Fix a Tor Launcher hang on TBB exit\n   </ul>\n<li>Update Torbutton to 1.6.5.2\n<ul>\n<li>Misc: Switch update download URL back to download-easy\n   </ul>\n</ul>\n</ul>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the 26th issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>The 3.x series of the Tor Browser Bundle is now stable</h1>\n<p>After more than a year of work, Mike Perry has officially <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-bundle-35-released\">blessed the 3.5 release of the Tor Browser Bundle as the new stable release</a>.  Improving on the previous stable series, it features a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details\">deterministic build system</a> for <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise\">distributed trust</a>, a new <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-launcher.git\">integrated interface to interact with Tor</a> and all the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-December/031392.html\">improvements from Tor 0.2.4</a>.</p>\n<p>Users of the previous 2.x series might be a little disoriented by the user interface changes. David Fifield, Matt Pagan and others have been compiling <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBrowserBundle3FAQ\">the most frequent questions</a> heard after the switch. Until the integrated browser interface catches up, <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~erinn/vidalia-standalone-bundles/\">new Vidalia bundles are now available</a> for those who need them. Erinn Clark is ironing out the remaining integration issues.</p>\n<p>With the discontinuation of Firefox 17 ESR, the new release had to be pushed to users to avoid exposing them to security holes.  Firefox 24 ESR, on which the Tor Browser is now based, should be supported by Mozilla for approximately one year. This will leave our browser hackers some time to focus more on user experience improvements, test automation, and better resistance to fingerprinting issues.</p>\n<p>Several tutorials, videos, and bits of documentation might now in one way or another be out-of-date in many places. Please help report them or, even better, write up some updated versions.</p>\n<p>This release is quite a milestone for the project. Update and enjoy!</p>\n<h1>The Tor Project now accepts donation in Bitcoin</h1>\n<p>As is often pointed out in the press, the majority of the Tor Project’s financial support comes from US government-linked organizations. In the ongoing effort to offer as many possible ways for individuals and organizations to give help to the project, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/announcement-tor-project-now-accepting-bitcoin-donations\">Bitcoin donations are now being accepted</a>.</p>\n<p>As Roger Dingledine wrote in a subsequent comment: “We really need to get some funding for core Tor development, and especially for improving Tor’s anonymity, because none of our current funders care enough about the anonymity side of Tor. Outreach and blocking-resistance are great topics, but we can’t let the anonymity part rot.”</p>\n<p>Head over to the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/donate/donate#bitcoin\">donations page</a> to learn more about how to chip in with Bitcoins or other currencies.</p>\n<h1>Tor 0.2.4.20 is out</h1>\n<p>The first update to the new stable branch of Tor has been <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-December/031483.html\">released</a> on December 23rd. It fixes an issue that would create more preemptive circuits than actually need, and a security issue related to poor random number generation.</p>\n<p>The latter affects “users who 1) use OpenSSL 1.0.0 or later, 2) set ‘HardwareAccel 1’ in their torrc file, 3) have ‘Sandy Bridge’ or ‘Ivy Bridge’ Intel processors, and 4) have no state file in their DataDirectory (as would happen on first start). Users who generated relay or hidden service identity keys in such a situation should discard them and generate new ones.”</p>\n<p>The source code is already available from <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">the usual location</a>. Update packages and bundles should be ready soon.</p>\n<h1>Tor events at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress</h1>\n<p>The Chaos Computer Club will be holding <a href=\"https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2013/30c3\">its 30th Congress</a> in Hamburg between the 27th and the 30th of December, and as usual there are a number of Tor-related talks and events scheduled.</p>\n<p>Following their <a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/video/29c3-5306-en-the_tor_software_ecosystem_h264.mp4\">session on the Tor ecosystem at 29c3</a>, Tor Project members Roger Dingledine and Jacob Appelbaum will be giving a talk entitled “<a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/Fahrplan/events/5423.html\">The Tor Network: We’re living in interesting times</a>”, in which they discuss the Project’s work over the last few years, with special reference to “major cryptographic upgrades in the Tor network, interesting academic papers in attacking the Tor network, major high profile users breaking news about the network itself, discussions about funding, FBI/NSA exploitation of Tor Browser users, botnet related load on the Tor network, and other important topics”.</p>\n<p>Their talk will be followed by a <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Session:How_to_help_Tor%3F\">discussion involving everyone interested in helping Tor</a> at the NoisySquare assembly. The Tor ecosystem is now made up of more than forty different projects, and there are sure to be ways you can help. Bring your skills and your energy!</p>\n<p>Torservers.net will be holding a <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Session:Tor_Relay_Operators_Meetup\">meeting of Tor relay operators and organizations</a>, featuring “quick presentations on recent and future activities around Torservers.net”, to be followed by the official members’ meeting of the German Torservers.net partner organization, Zwiebelfreunde e.V.</p>\n<p>#youbroketheinternet will hold a session on the <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Session:YBTI_Cryptographic_Routing\">future of crypto routing backends</a>: “Even the IETF is now considering that Onion Routing should be a fundamental capability of the Internet. How would that look in practice?”</p>\n<p>If you are attending the Congress, feel free to come along and participate in these sessions; if not, you should be able to catch up with the talks online.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Anthony G. Basile <a href=\"http://opensource.dyc.edu/pipermail/tor-ramdisk/2013-December/000107.html\">released version 20131216</a> of Tor-ramdisk, a “uClibc-based micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that maximizes security and privacy.” This new release is the first to ship the 0.2.4 branch of Tor.</p>\n<p>For those who like hazardous experiments, intrigeri sent a <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-December/004538.html\">call for testing</a> an experimental Tails image with preliminary UEFI support — users of Apple hardware should be particularly interested. anonym also <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2013-December/004547.html\">announced</a> that test images from the MAC spoofing branch were available.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson sent his now-monthly <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-December/005957.html\">review of the status of Tor’s proposals</a>. Karsten Loesing followed-up by commenting on several of those related to the directory protocol. Have a look, you might also be able to move things forward!</p>\n<p>Many thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-December/000403.html\">John Sweeney of otivpn.com</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-December/000411.html\">Jeremy J. Olson of EPRCI</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2013-December/000415.html\">les.net</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project website.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing has been <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10460\">experimenting</a> with replacementsfor the “fast exits” graphs that would convey a better feeling of the network growth. He also deployed a new visualization for the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/performance.html#connbidirect\">fraction of connections used uni-/bidirectionally</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Multiple users have now emailed the help desk regarding a particular type of “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware_%28malware%29\">ransomware</a>” that encrypts the hard drive of Windows computers and won’t give users the decryption key until a payment is made. Victims of this malware have emailed the help desk because the ransomware message includes a link to a tor hidden service site. Malware victims wanted to know how to install the Tor Browser, or thought the Tor Project was the source of the malware.</p>\n<p>The Tor Project does not make malware; in the past Tor developers have worked with anti-virus developers to help stop other types of malware.  Users affected might find useful information in the <a href=\"http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/cryptolocker-ransomware-information\">guide assembled by BleepingComputer.com</a>.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the first issue for the year 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the impressive Tor community. The tor-news mailing list has reached a thousand subscribers. Thanks for following us!</p>\n<h1>Tor at the 30th Chaos Communication Congress</h1>\n<p>The Chaos Computer Club held its <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/\">thirtieth congress</a> in Hamburg, Germany during the days and nights of December 26th-30th. The congress had over 9,000 participants. The topic of pervasive surveillance was more present than ever, and Tor was a common answer to many questions.</p>\n<p>“We are living in interesting times” was the subtitle of Jacob Appelbaum<br />\nand Roger Dingledine’s <a href=\"http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/30C3_-_5423_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312272030_-_the_tor_network_-_jacob_-_arma.html\">talk for this year</a>. Their tour of what happened to Tor in the past years and more importantly in the past months was seen by more than 3,000 attendees in Hamburg and a couple more from the live stream and recordings. Later on, Sophie Bayerlein had decorated a wall with her <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/Projects:VisualNotes#The_TOR_Project\">visual summary of the talk</a>.</p>\n<p>The talk was quickly followed by a “How to help Tor?” workshop.  Lunar <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-January/000420.html\">reported</a> “an overwhelming success as more than 200 people showed up. We were not prepared for helping so many folks waiting to learn how they can help Tor. It still created interesting discussions, I believe, and I hope we will find ways to interact more with the larger community in the upcoming weeks, especially concerning outreach to the general public.”</p>\n<p>Earlier the same day, a meetup of Tor relay operators was held. The small room was packed with at least 60-70 attendees. Several relay operator organizations reported on their progress: <a href=\"https://www.dfri.se/wiki/20131227-DFRI.pdf\">DFRI</a>, Frënn vun der Ënn, <a href=\"http://icetor.is/slides/icetor-relay-slides.pdf\">Icetor</a>, Noisetor, <a href=\"https://nos-oignons.net/Pr%C3%A9sentations/30C3/2013-12-27-30C3-Tor_relay_ops-Nos-oignons.pdf\">Nos oignons</a>, <a href=\"http://www.privacyfoundation.ch/assets/files/presentation_association_20131227.pdf\">Swiss Privacy Foundation</a> and Zwiebelfreunde. Many of these projects did not exist last year, and new organizations are still being created, like <a href=\"http://www.torrorists.de/\">The Torrorists</a> who also gave a quick status update. Nikita Borisov gave a quick presentation of the <a href=\"http://web.engr.illinois.edu/~das17/tor-traceroute_v1.html\">traceroute research experiment</a> and encouraged more operators to run the test script. Several operators of important relays and directory authorities also assisted the session.  Let’s hope everyone shared the same feelings as Jason from Icetor: “It was really excellent meeting all of you and great for my morale to see all the people understanding and working towards common goals. Perhaps it’s just due to my remoteness, but I rarely get to discuss projects like this at such an intricate level.”</p>\n<p>On the lightning talks front, Kai Engert presented <a href=\"http://detector.io/\">DetecTor</a> (<a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2013/wiki/images/1/1b/LT-Day_3-14.45-DetecTor.IO.pdf\">slides</a>, <a href=\"http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/30C3_-_5563_-_en_-_saal_g_-_201312291245_-_lightning_talks_day_3_-_nickfarr.html\">video</a> at 1:56:25), David Fifield <a href=\"https://www.bamsoftware.com/talks/30c3-pt/\">covered the basics of Tor pluggable transports</a>, and Michael Zeltner introduced <a href=\"https://poum.niij.org/\">tor2tcp</a> (<a href=\"http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2013/30C3_-_5564_-_en_-_saal_g_-_201312301245_-_lightning_talks_day_4_-_nickfarr.html\">video</a> at 1:41:00). Some <a href=\"https://www.onioncat.org/\">OnionCat</a> developers have also been spotted in the corridors.</p>\n<p>The Chaos Communication Congress is one of the rare events where an impressive number of members of the Tor community have a chance to interact. Let’s hope it has been a fruitful time for everyone!</p>\n<h1>Tor website needs your help!</h1>\n<p>One of the outcomes of the “How to help Tor?” session at the 30C3 was that there were quite some people interested in helping the Tor project with its website. In order to foster anyone’s participation, a larger <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-website-needs-your-help\">call for help</a> has been sent.</p>\n<p>It starts by acknowledging that “Tor has shifted in the recent years from being a project prominently used by researchers, developers, and security experts to the wider audience of anyone concerned about their privacy”. As its primary audience shifted, “it is again time for important changes” to the website structure and design.</p>\n<p>As one can read in the call or <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?component=Website&amp;order=status\">browse through the website related tickets</a>, it’s going to be a challenging task.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the second issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Orbot 13 is out</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/\">Orbot</a> — the Guardian Project’s port of Tor on Android platforms — has received a <a href=\"https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-January/002973.html\">major update</a>. Version 13 includes “all the latest bling across the board” meaning Tor 0.2.4.20 and updated versions of OpenSSL and XTables. Nathan also mentions “some important fixes to the Orbot service, to ensure it remains running in the background, and the active notification keeps working, as well. Finally, we’ve changed the way the native binaries are installed, making it more reliable and clean across devices.”</p>\n<p>After the initial release candidates, <a href=\"https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-January/003016.html\">13.0.1</a>, 13.0.2 and then 13.0.3 were quickly made available to fix various reported issues.</p>\n<p>The new release is available from the <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/releases/\">Guardian Project’s website</a>, F-Droid repository or Google Play.</p>\n<h1>Who are the Tor Project’s website visitors?</h1>\n<p>Last week’s <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-website-needs-your-help\">call for help regarding the Tor Project’s website</a> has seen a pretty impressive response. Discussions then quickly sparkled on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/www-team\">newly created mailing list</a>.</p>\n<p>As one of the first concrete outcomes, Rey Dhuny contributed an initial set of “personas”, later improved by Max Jakob Maass, Silviu Riley with suggestions from others. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_%28user_experience%29\">Quoting Wikipedia</a>: “personas are fictional characters created to represent the different user types within a targeted demographic, attitude and/or behavior set that might use a site, brand or product in a similar way.”</p>\n<p>One can have a look at <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/Website#Personas\">the wiki page</a> to learn more about the seven different users of the Tor website that have been currently identified: The Student, The Journalist, The Researcher, The Donor, The Engineer, The Activist, The Dissident. These personas should probably be further refined, but are already a very useful tool to think about how to structure a new website.</p>\n<p>For anyone interested in following the effort, Andrew Lewman has spent time triaging <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/report/45\">all website related tickets</a> and setting up <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/milestone/Tor%20Website%203.0\">a new milestone</a> to keep tabs on tasks and issues.</p>\n<h1>Let’s save Tor Weather!</h1>\n<p>The Tor network would not exist without all its volunteers — currently more than 3,000 all around the world — who run the 5,000+ relays anonymizing our connections.</p>\n<p>Tor Weather is one of these small services run by the Tor Project that is meant to make the life of relay operators easier. It can warn them when their relay is down or when a new version of tor is available… and when they can receive the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/tshirt.html\">rewarding t-shirt</a>. Unfortunately, Tor Weather has been unmaintained for quite a while, and <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?component=Tor+Weather&amp;order=status\">issues have accumulated</a> over time.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing has sent a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006039.html\">call for help</a> with suggestions on how the code can be simplified and improved. Abhiram Chintangal and Norbert Kurz have already stated their interests. Coordination is done through the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-dev\">tor-dev mailing list </a> and a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/weather-in-2014\">design wiki page</a>. Join them if you are up to some Python hacking or spiffing up the web interface!</p>\n<h1>More monthly status reports for December 2013</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of December 2013 continued this week as well with the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2013_12/\">extended report form the Tails team</a> followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-January/000427.html\">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-January/000428.html\">Kevin P Dyer</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-January/000430.html\">Andrew Lewman</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>The Tails team has put out a <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/test_0.22.1-rc1/\">call for testing the first release candidate for Tails 0.22.1</a>. The new version will bring several bugfixes, an updated kernel, and many improvements to the upgrader application.</p>\n<p>Directory authorities are in <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10324\">the process</a> of upgrading their directory signing key to RSA 2048. This has been done for <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~linus/sign2048.html\">five out of nine authorities</a>. The changes might result in some temporary error messages in logs of Tor relays, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-January/003592.html\">as it did</a> when <a href=\"https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/F2044413DAC2E02E3D6BCF4735A19BCA1DE97281\">gabelmoo</a> changed its key on January 11th.</p>\n<p>Nicolas Vigier has sent <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006047.html\">a proposal</a> about replacing the current Gitian-based build system for the Tor Browser Bundle by a system based on <a href=\"http://burps.boklm.eu/\">burps</a>. Nicolas also worked on <a href=\"https://github.com/boklm/burps-tor\">a prototype</a> to go with his proposal.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006038.html\">mentioned</a> that the <a href=\"http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~jansen/papers/sniper-ndss2014.pdf\">“Sniper Attack” paper</a> by Rob Jansen, Florian Tschorsch, Aaron Johnson, and Björn Scheuermann was now available. This paper describes serious Denial of Service attacks through memory exhaustion. The issue is fixed “thanks to advice from the paper’s authors, in Tor 0.2.4.x and later”.</p>\n<p>In order to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/8244\">prevent attacks</a> on hidden services based on predicting which directory will be used, directory authorities need to periodically produce shared unpredictable random strings. To address the issue, Nicholas Hopper has sent <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006053.html\">a threshold signature-based proposal for a shared RNG</a>, now up for reviews.</p>\n<p>The next session of low-hanging fruits for Tails <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/contribute/meetings/201401/\">will happen</a> on February 8th in the #tails IRC channel OFTC at 10:00 CET.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-January/000439.html\">stalkr.net</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-January/000442.html\">Maki Hoshisawa</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-January/000443.html\">cYbergueRrilLa AnonyMous NeXus</a> for running new mirrors of the Tor Project website.</p>\n<p>Jaromil <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031632.html\">announced</a> the release of <a href=\"http://dyne.org/software/dowse\">Dowse</a>, “a transparent proxy setup supporting Tor”. One feature is that it detects “all URLs whose domain ends in .onion, routing them directly to Tor, effectively making the onion network accessible without any plugin or software installed.” The transport proxy approach has <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2013-July/028833.html\">known issues</a> but can still be of interest to some users. Jaromil is seeking feedback and opinions from the community.</p>\n<p>Microsoft’s Geoff McDonald wrote a <a href=\"https://blogs.technet.com/b/mmpc/archive/2014/01/09/tackling-the-sefnit-botnet-tor-hazard.aspx\">blog post</a> describing how they have helped remove half of the estimated <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-to-handle-millions-new-tor-clients\">four millions of Tor clients</a> installed by the Sefnit botnet without the computer owner’s knowledge.</p>\n<p>Koumbit has been working on <a href=\"https://redmine.koumbit.net/projects/torride\">Torride</a>, a live distribution to run Tor relays — not unlike <a href=\"http://opensource.dyc.edu/tor-ramdisk/\">Tor-ramdisk</a> — but based on Debian. Version 1.1.0 has been <a href=\"https://redmine.koumbit.net/news/17\">released</a> on January 10th.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Many users have been emailing for clarification on the Tor Browser’s interface. The first time Tor Browser is started, users are asked if their network is free of obstacles. Many users do not know if their network is free of obstacles or not. A network is free of obstacles if it does not censor connections to the Tor network. Ticket <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10610\">#10610</a> has been opened to discuss possible improvements.</p>\n<p>A number of users have reported problems using the Tor Browser in Backtrack Linux. Backtrack is unusual among Linux distributions in that the user can only log in as root; there are no other user accounts. The Tor Browser cannot be run as root. One solution for Backtrack users is to create a new account with the <code>useradd</code> command and then run the Tor Browser as that user with the <code>sudo</code> command.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, Matt Pagan, dope457, Sandeep, Karsten Loesing, Nicolas Vigier, Philipp Winter and the Tails developers.</p>\n<p>Tor Weekly News needs reviewers! 24 hours before being published, the content of the next newsletter is frozen so there is time to improve the language.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the third issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Future of the geolocalization database used in Tor software</h1>\n<p>The first version of Tor to include an IP-to-country database was <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/tree/ee60a8dd\">0.2.0.27-rc</a>, released in 2008. In 2010, the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/commit/befcc84f\">database switched</a> from data provided by WebHosting.Info to use the more up-to-date MaxMind’s GeoLite service. All was good, until two years later when MaxMind started to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/6266\">hide the country of Tor relays</a>, marking them as from the “A1” country, standing for “anonymous proxy”.  Karsten Loesing has been tirelessly doing manual database updates ever since.</p>\n<p>MaxMind has <a href=\"http://blog.maxmind.com/2013/07/01/introducing-the-geoip2-beta/\">launched GeoIP2</a> as a successor of its previous service.  The very good news, as <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006080.html\">spotted by Karsten</a>, is that the new format “provide the A1/A2 information in *addition* to the correct country codes”.</p>\n<p>The question lies on how should this new database be integrated into the different software using geolocalization information: Tor, BridgeDB, the metrics database and the metrics website. The format used by Tor so far has always been a custom format, so writing a converter from MaxMind’s database format is one option. Another option is to integrate the parsing libraries provided by MaxMind into Tor software.</p>\n<p>Both approaches have their advantages. In any cases, they can be useful, fun and small projects for someone new to the Tor community. Be sure to have a look at Karsten’s suggestions if you feel like helping.</p>\n<h1>Key generation on headless and diskless relays</h1>\n<p>Following up on his work on <a href=\"https://redmine.koumbit.net/projects/torride\">Torride</a> — a live Linux distribution meant to run Tor relays — anarcat asked about key generation in low entropy situation. Lunar had <a href=\"http://opensource.dyc.edu/pipermail/tor-ramdisk/2013-January/000101.html\">raised</a> a similar question for the <a href=\"http://opensource.dyc.edu/tor-ramdisk/\">Tor-ramdisk distribution</a> a couple of months ago.</p>\n<p>“The concern here is what happens when Tor starts up the first time. I believe it creates a public/private key pair for its cryptographic routines. In Torride, this is done right on the start of the operating system, when the entropy of the system is low or inexistent” explained anarcat.</p>\n<p>Gerardus Hendricks has made a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031725.html\">quick analysis</a> of Tor source code to determine that key were generated using entropy from <code>/dev/urandom</code> — an insecure behavior in low entropy situation.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031773.html\">suggested</a> to change the initialization procedure in order to “try to read a byte from <code>/dev/random</code> before it starts Tor, and block until it actually can read that byte.“ This would “ensure that the kernel RNG has (by its own lights) reached full entropy at least once, which guarantees cryptographic quality of the rest of the <code>/dev/urandom</code> stream.” More general solutions are now discussed in a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10676\">newly created ticket</a>.</p>\n<h1>Exposing malicious exit relays</h1>\n<p>Anyone is free to start a new Tor relay and join the Tor network. Most Tor relay operators are volunteers who dedicate time and money to support online privacy.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as Philipp Winter and Stefan Lindskog wrote in the introduction of their <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/\">new research project</a>, “there are exceptions: in the past, some exit relays were documented to have <a href=\"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mikepo/papers/tordecoys.raid11.pdf\">sniffed</a> and <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/badRelays\">tampered with</a> relayed traffic”. The project, dubbed “spoiled onions”, is meant to “monitoring all exit relays for several months in order to expose, document, and thwart malicious or misconfigured relays”.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/techreport.pdf\">paper</a> gives more details on the <a href=\"https://github.com/NullHypothesis/exitmap\">modular scanning software</a> that has been developed. It elaborates on how it can detect tampering with the HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, and DNS protocols. The paper also discusses that occasionally it’s the relay’s ISP that is responsible for an attack despite the operator’s good faith.</p>\n<p>The authors also describe an extension to the Tor Browser that can help with detecting HTTPS man-in-the-middle attacks: if the browser is unable to verify a certificate, it will automatically retrieve the certificate again using a different Tor exit node. If the certificates do not match, a warning can then be issued informing the user that an attack might be happening and offering to notify the Tor Project. However, the extension is merely a proof of concept and not usable at this point.</p>\n<p>Philipp and Stefan’s efforts have already identified 25 bad relays that have subsequently been marked as such by directory authority operators.  Even if we wish the number of problematic relays to stay low, let’s hope this will help to identify those who try to abuse Tor users as soon as possible in the future.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Alex <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-January/003620.html\">reported</a> his bad experience with Hetzner when attempting to participate in the <a href=\"https://web.engr.illinois.edu/~das17/tor-traceroute_v1.html\">“Trusted Tor Traceroutes” experiment</a>. Paul Görgen <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-January/003625.html\">reported</a> having similar troubles, even with a lower packet per second rate. Relay operators might want to warn their ISP before undertaking the experiment in the future to avoid similar misadventures.</p>\n<p>Anupam Das <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-January/003686.html\">reported</a> that they have “received a good rate of participation by relay operators to <a href=\"https://web.engr.illinois.edu/~das17/tor-traceroute_v1.html\">our measurement project</a>”. To measure progress, there is now a <a href=\"http://128.174.241.211:443/relay_scoreboard\">live scoreboard</a> of all participants.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9444\">integration of “pluggable transports” in the main Tor Browser Bundle</a> is moving smoothly. David Fifield published <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/dcf/tor-browser-bundle.git/shortlog/refs/heads/3.6-beta\">beta images of his recent work</a>, and the initial implementation <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10418\">adding a default set of bridges to Tor Launcher</a> has been completed.</p>\n<p>Following up on last week <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006039.html\">call for help</a> regarding <a href=\"https://weather.torproject.org/\">Tor Weather</a>, Karsten Loesing is <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006102.html\">organizing an IRC meeting</a> with interested developers on Wed, Jan 22, 18:00 UTC.

    "content": "<p>Together with Stefan, I recently published the paper \"<a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spoiled Onions: Exposing Malicious Tor Exit Relays</a>\".  The paper only discusses our results and how we obtained them and we don't talk a lot about the implications for Tor users.  This blog post should fill that gap.</p>\n<p>First, it's important to understand that 25 relays in four months isn't a lot.  It is ultimately a very small fraction of the Tor network.  Also, it doesn't mean that 25 out of 1,000 relays are malicious or misconfigured (we weren't very clear on that in the paper).  We have yet to calculate the churn rate of exit relays which is the rate at which relays join and leave the network.  1,000 is really just the approximate number of exit relays at any given point in time.  So the actual number of exit relays we ended up testing in four months is certainly higher than that.  As a user, that means that you will not see many malicious relays \"in the wild\".</p>\n<p>Second, Tor clients select relays in their circuits based on the bandwidth they are contributing to the network.  Faster relays see more traffic than slower relays which balances the load in the Tor network.  Many of the malicious exit relays contributed relatively little bandwidth to the Tor network which makes them quite unlikely to be chosen as relay in a circuit.</p>\n<p>Third, even if your traffic is going through a malicious exit relay, it doesn't mean that everything is lost.  Many of the attacks we discovered still caused Firefox' infamous \"about:certerror\" warning page.  As a vigilant user, you would notice that something isn't quite right and hopefully leave the site.  In addition, TorBrowser ships with <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/Https-everywhere\" rel=\"nofollow\">HTTPS-Everywhere</a> which by default attempts to connect to some sites over HTTPS even though you just typed \"http://\".  After all, as we said in the past, \"<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/plaintext-over-tor-still-plaintext\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plaintext over Tor is still plaintext</a>\".</p>\n<p>Finally, we want to point out that all of these attacks are of course not limited to the Tor network.  You face the very same risks when you are connecting to any public WiFi network.  One of the fundamental problems is the broken CA system.  Do you actually know all the ~50 organisation who you implicitly trust when you start your Firefox, Chrome, or TorBrowser?  Making the CA system more secure is a very challenging task for the entire Internet and not just the Tor network.</p>"

The attack is an extremely <b>low resource</b> attack in which an adversary's bandwidth may be traded for a target relay's memory (RAM) at an amplification rate of one to two orders of magnitude. Ironically, the adversary can use Tor to protect it's identity while attacking Tor without significantly reducing the effectiveness of the attack.</p>\n<p>We studied <b>relay availability</b> under the attack using <a href=\"https://shadow.github.io/\">Shadow</a>, a discrete-event network simulator that runs the real Tor software in a safe, private testing environment, and found that we could disable each of the fastest guard and the fastest exit relay in a range of 1-18 minutes (depending on relay RAM capacity). We also found that the entire group of the top 20 exit relays, representing roughly 35% of Tor bandwidth capacity at the time of the analysis, could be disabled in a range of 29 minutes to 3 hours and 50 minutes. We also analyzed how the attack could potentially be used to <b>deanonymize</b> hidden services, and found that it would take between 4 and 278 hours before the attack would succeed (again depending on relay RAM capacity, as well as the bandwidth resources used to launch the attack).</p>\n<p>Due to our devastating findings, we also designed three defenses that mitigate our attacks, one of which provably renders the attack ineffective. Defenses have been implemented and deployed into the Tor software to ensure that <b>the Tor network is no longer vulnerable as of Tor version 0.2.4.18-rc and later</b>. Some of that work can be found in Trac tickets <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9063\">#9063</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9072\">#9072</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9093\">#9093</a>, and <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10169\">#10169</a>.</p>\n<p>In the remainder of this post I will detail the attacks and defenses we analyzed, noting again that this information is presented more completely (and more elegantly) in <a href=\"https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~jansen/publications/sniper-ndss2014.pdf\">our paper</a>.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h1>The Tor Network Infrastructure</h1>\n<p>The Tor network is a distributed system made up of thousands of computers running the Tor software that contribute their bandwidth, memory, and computational resources for the greater good. These machines are called Tor <b>relays</b>, because their main task is to forward or relay network traffic to another entity after performing some cryptographic operations. When a Tor user wants to download some data using Tor, the user's Tor client software will choose three relays from those available (an <b>entry</b>, <b>middle</b>, and <b>exit</b>), form a path or <b>circuit</b> between these relays, and then instruct the third relay (the exit) to fetch the data and send it back through the circuit. The data will get transferred from its source to the exit, from the exit to the middle, and from the middle to the entry before finally making its way to the client.</p>\n<h1>Flow Control</h1>\n<p>The client may request the exit to fetch large amounts of data, and so Tor uses a window-based <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_%28data%29\">flow control</a> scheme in order to limit the amount of data each relay needs to buffer in memory at once. When a circuit is created, the exit will initialize its circuit <b>package</b> counter to 1000 cells, indicating that it is willing to send 1000 cells into the circuit. The exit decrements the package counter by one for every data cell it sends into the circuit (to the middle relay), and stops sending data when the package counter reaches 0. The client at the other end of the circuit keeps a <b>delivery</b> counter, and initializes it to 0 upon circuit creation. The client increments the delivery counter by 1 for every data cell it receives on that circuit. When the client's delivery counter reaches 100, it sends a special Tor control cell, called a SENDME cell, to the exit to signal that it received 100 cells. Upon receiving the SENDME, the exit adds 100 to its package counter and continues sending data into the circuit.</p>\n<p>This flow control scheme limits the amount of outstanding data that may be in flight at any time (between the exit and the client) to 1000 cells, or about 500 KiB, per circuit. The same mechanism is used when data is flowing in the opposite direction (up from the client, through the entry and middle, and to the exit).</p>\n<h1>The Sniper Attack</h1>\n<p>The new Denial of Service (DoS) attack, which we call <b>\"The Sniper Attack\"</b>, exploits the flow control algorithm to remotely crash a victim Tor relay by depleting its memory resources. The paper presents three attacks that rely on the following two techniques:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> the attacker <b>stops reading from the TCP connection containing the attack circuit</b>, which causes the TCP window on the victim's outgoing connection to close and the victim to buffer up to 1000 cells; and</li>\n<li> the attacker causes cells to be continuously sent to the victim (exceeding the 1000 cell limit and consuming the victim's memory resources) either by <b>ignoring the package window at packaging end</b> of the circuit, or by <b>continuously sending SENDMEs from the delivery end</b> to the packaging end even though no cells have been read by the delivery end.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/><br />\nI'll outline the attacks here, but remember that the <a href=\"https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~jansen/publications/sniper-ndss2014.pdf\">paper</a> and <a href=\"https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~jansen/talks/sniper-dcaps-20131011.pdf\">slides</a> provide more details and useful illustrations of each of the three versions of the attack.</p>\n<h2>Basic Version 1 (attacking an entry relay)</h2>\n<p>In basic version 1, the adversary controls the client and the exit relay, and chooses a victim for the entry relay position. The adversary builds a circuit through the victim to her own exit, and then the exit continuously generates and sends arbitrary data through the circuit toward the client while ignoring the package window limit. The client stops reading from the TCP connection to the entry relay, and the entry relay buffers all data being sent by the exit relay until it is killed by its OS out-of-memory killer.</p>\n<h2>Basic Version 2 (attacking an exit relay)</h2>\n<p>In basic version 2, the adversary controls the client and an Internet destination server (e.g. website), and chooses a victim for the exit relay position. The adversary builds a circuit through the victim exit relay, and then the client continuously generates and sends arbitrary data through the circuit toward the exit relay while ignoring the package window limit. The destination server stops reading from the TCP connection to the exit relay, and the exit relay buffers all data being sent by the client until it is killed by its OS out-of-memory killer.</p>\n<h2>Efficient Version</h2>\n<p>Both of the basic versions of the attack above require the adversary to generate and send data, consuming roughly the same amount of upstream bandwidth as the victim's available memory. The efficient version reduces this cost by one to two orders of magnitude.</p>\n<p>In the efficient version, the adversary controls <b>only a client</b>. She creates a circuit, choosing the victim for the entry position, and then instructs the exit relay to download a large file from some external Internet server. The client stops reading on the TCP connection to the entry relay, causing it to buffer 1000 cells.</p>\n<p>At this point, the adversary may \"trick\" the exit relay into sending more cells by sending it a SENDME cell, even though the client has not actually received any cells from the entry. As long as this SENDME does not increase the exit relay's package counter to greater than 1000 cells, the exit relay will continue to package data from the server and send it into the circuit toward the victim. If the SENDME does cause the exit relay's package window to exceed the 1000 cell limit, it will stop responding on that circuit. However, the entry and middle node will hold the circuit open until the client issues another command, meaning its resources will not be freed.</p>\n<p>The bandwidth cost of the attack after circuit creation is simply the bandwidth cost of occasionally sending a SENDME to the exit. The memory consumption speed depends on the bandwidth and congestion of non-victim circuit relays. We describe how to parallelize the attack using multiple circuits and multiple paths with diverse relays in order to draw upon Tor's inherent resources. We found that with roughly 50 KiB/s of upstream bandwidth, an attacker could consume the victim's memory at roughly 1 MiB/s. This is highly dependent on the victim's bandwidth capabilities: relays that use token buckets to restrict bandwidth usage will of course bound the attack's consumption rate.</p>\n<p>Rather than connecting directly to the victim, the adversary may instead launch the attack through a separate Tor circuit using a second client instance and the \"Socks4Proxy\" or \"Socks5Proxy\" option. In this case, she may benefit from the anonymity that Tor itself provides in order to evade detection. We found that there is not a significant increase in bandwidth usage when anonymizing the attack in this way.</p>\n<h1>Defenses</h1>\n<p>A simple but naive defense against the Sniper Attack is to have the guard node watch its queue length, and if it ever fills to over 1000 cells, kill the circuit. This defense does not prevent the adversary from parallelizing the attack by using multiple circuits (and then consuming 1000 cells on each), which we have shown to be extremely effective.</p>\n<p>Another defense, called \"authenticated SENDMEs\", tries to protect against receiving a SENDME from a node that didn't actually receive 100 cells. In this approach, a 1 byte nonce is placed in every 100th cell by the packaging end, and that nonce must be included by the delivery end in the SENDME (otherwise the packaging end rejects the SENDME as inauthentic). As above, this does not protect against the parallel attack. It also doesn't defend against either of the basic attacks where the adversary controls the packaging end and ignores the SENDMEs anyway.</p>\n<p>The best defense, as we suggested to the Tor developers, is to implement a custom, adaptive out-of-memory circuit killer in application space (i.e. inside Tor). The circuit killer is only activated when memory becomes scarce, and then it chooses the circuit with the oldest front-most cell in its circuit queue. This will prevent the Sniper Attack by killing off all of the attack circuits.</p>\n<p>With this new defense in place, the next game is for the adversary to try to cause Tor to kill an honest circuit. In order for an adversary to cause an honest circuit to get killed, it must ensure that the front-most cell on its malicious circuit queue is at least slightly \"younger\" than the oldest cell on any honest queue. We show that the Sniper Attack is impractical with this defense: due to fairness mechanisms in Tor, the adversary must spend an extraordinary amount of bandwidth keeping its cells young &mdash; bandwidth that would likely be better served in a more traditional brute-force DoS attack.</p>\n<p>Tor has implemented a version of the out-of-memory killer for circuits, and is currently working on <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10169\">expanding this to channel and connection buffers</a> as well.</p>\n<h1>Hidden Service Attack and Countermeasures</h1>\n<p>The paper also shows how the Sniper Attack can be used to deanonymize hidden services:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> run a malicious entry guard relay;</li>\n<li> run <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#oakland2013-trawling\">the attack from Oakland 2013</a> to learn the current guard relay of the target hidden service;</li>\n<li> run the Sniper Attack on the guard from step 2, knocking it offline and causing the hidden service to choose a new guard;</li>\n<li> repeat, until the hidden service chooses the relay from step 1 as its new entry guard.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br/><br />\nThe technique to verify that the hidden service is using a malicious guard in step 4 is the same technique used in step 2.</p>\n<p>In the paper, we compute the expected time to succeed in this attack while running malicious relays of various capacities. It takes longer to succeed against relays that have more RAM, since it relies on the Sniper Attack to consume enough RAM to kill the relay (which itself depends on the bandwidth capacity of the victim relay). For the malicious relay bandwidth capacities and honest relay RAM amounts used in their estimate, we found that deanonymization would involve between 18 and 132 Sniper Attacks and take between ~4 and ~278 hours.</p>\n<p>This attack becomes much more difficult if the relay is rebooted soon after it crashes, and the attack is ineffective when Tor relays are properly defending against the Sniper Attack (see the \"Defenses\" section above).</p>\n<p>Strategies to defend hidden services in particular go beyond <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters\">those suggested here</a> to include <b>entry guard rate-limiting</b>, where you stop building circuits if you notice that your new guards keep going down (failing closed), and <b>middle guards</b>, guard nodes for your guard nodes. Both of these strategies attempt to make it harder to coerce the hidden service into building new circuits or exposing itself to new relays, since that is precisely what is needed for deanonymization.</p>\n<h1>Open Problems</h1>\n<p>The main defense implemented in Tor will start killing circuits when memory gets low. Currently, Tor uses a configuration option (MaxMemInCellQueues) that allows a relay operator to configure when the circuit-killer should be activated. There is likely not one single value that makes sense here: if it is too high, then relays with lower memory will not be protected; if it is too low, then there may be more false positives resulting in honest circuits being killed. Can Tor determine this setting in an OS-independent way that allows relays to automatically find the right value for MaxMemInCellQueues?</p>\n<p>The defenses against the Sniper Attack prevent the adversary from crashing the victim relay, but the adversary may still consume a relay's bandwidth (and memory resources, to a critical level) at relatively low cost. This means that even though the Sniper Attack can no longer kill a relay, it can still consume a large amount of its bandwidth at a relatively low cost (similar to more traditional bandwidth amplification attacks). More analysis of <b>general bandwidth consumption attacks and defenses</b> remains a useful research problem.</p>\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love\">hidden services also need some love</a>. More work is needed to redesign them in a way that does not allow a client to cause the hidden service to choose new relays on demand.</p>"

Many researchers involved with Tor and privacy technologies were also present.</p>\n<p>As far as talks were concerned, Tom Shrimpton presented the <a href=\"https://fteproxy.org/\">Format-Transforming Encryption (FTE) traffic obfuscation tool</a> which is currently being developed to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10362\">work as a Tor pluggable transport</a>.  The Tor developers present also worked with Kevin Dyer, one of the paper authors and developers of FTE, towards including FTE in the Pluggable Transport Tor bundles.</p>\n<p>On the censorship circumvention front, I2P developers showed interest in using pluggable transports. Work has been done to identify various problems with the current PT spec that need to be fixed so that other projects can <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10629\">use pluggable transports more smoothly</a>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there were talks with the developers of <a href=\"https://uproxy.org/\">UProxy</a> (a censorship circumvention tool made by Google) and helped them understand how pluggable transports work and what they would need to do if they wanted to use them in UProxy. They seemed interested and motivated to work on this.</p>\n<p>The Tor developers also worked on the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt\">Next Generation Hidden Services</a> project, and sketched out some ways to move forward even though there are some <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006099.html\">open research questions</a> with the current design.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson commented on IRC: “I think the hallway track to main conference utility ratio was higher than usual, since the conference actually sticks practitioners and cryptographers in the same room pretty reliably.” Let’s hope for next year!</p>\n<h1>The media and some terminology</h1>\n<p>BusinessWeek published <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-01-23/tor-anonymity-software-vs-dot-the-national-security-agency\">The inside story of Tor, the best Internet anonymity tool the government ever built</a>. Better that what one can usually read about Tor in the press, the piece — courtesy of Dune Lawrence — still sparkled a discussion on the tor-talk mailing list <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031863.html\">about terminology</a>.</p>\n<p>Katya Titov quoted a misleading part of the article: “In addition to facilitating anonymous communication online, Tor is an access point to the ‘dark Web’, vast reaches of the Internet that are intentionally kept hidden and don’t show up in Google or other search engines, […].”</p>\n<p>As references to the “dark web”, the “deep web”, or the “dark deep shady Knockturn Alley of the Internet” have been popping up more and more in the media over the past months, Katya wanted to come up with proper definitions of commonly misunderstood terms to reduce misinformation and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt\">FUD</a>.</p>\n<p>She summarized the result of the discussion in a new <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/HowBigIsTheDarkWeb\">HowBigIsTheDarkWeb</a> wiki page. Be sure to point it to your fellow journalists!</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>To follow up on last week’s Tor Weekly News coverage, Philipp Winter wrote a blog post to explain <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/what-spoiled-onions-paper-means-tor-users\">what the “Spoiled Onions” paper means for Tor users</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Sukhbir Singh, users with @outlook.com email addresses can now <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/6591#comment:4\">request bridges and bundles via email</a>.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10699#comment:3\">dug some statistics</a> about the Tor Weather service. There are currently 1846 different email addresses subscribed for 2349 Tor relays.</p>\n<p>Tor developers will be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/torproject/status/427922491948818432\">present</a> at the Mozilla booth during FOSDEM’14 .  Drop by if you have questions or want to get involved in Tor!</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Users repeatedly contact Tor help desk about unreachable hidden services. If that happens, please first make sure the system clock is accurate and try to visit the <a href=\"http://idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion/\">hidden service for the Tor Project’s website</a> (<code>idnxcnkne4qt76tg.onion</code>). If it works, it means that Tor is working as it should and there’s nothing more the Tor Project can do. Hidden services are solely under the responsibility of their operators and they are the only one that can do something when a hidden service goes offline.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>Alex Ryan has been experiencing <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1302/88\">crashes of his relay running on a Raspberry Pi</a> due to circuit creation storms. He found out that the problem disappeared after upgrading to the new 0.2.4 series of Tor.  There are currently no official Raspbian packages, so users will have to build the package manually from source.</p>\n<p>User cypherpunks wanted to know <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1339/88\">how to report security issues to the Tor Project</a>. Until <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9186\">a proper process is decided</a>, the best way at the moment is to contact Nick Mathewson, Andrea Shepard, or Roger Dingledine privately using their GnuPG keys.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1337/88\">How many hidden services can be served from a single Tor instance?</a> Syrian Watermelon is looking to know if there is a hard limit and how memory usage will go.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the fifth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>News from the browser team front</h1>\n<p>Mike Perry has a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000438.html\">detailed report</a> about what the growing Tor Browser team has been up to. Among the good news, new fingerprinting defenses are getting close to be merged for “screen resolution, default character sets, site permissions, and local service enumeration”. Some other changes that will reduce the attack surface include “disabling addon update requests for addons that should not update, a potential fix for a disk leak in the browser’s video cache, […], and a potential fix to prevent the Flash plugin from being loaded into the browser at all until the user actually requests to use it.”</p>\n<p>Most censored users currently have to use a separate browser bundle dubbed “pluggable transports bundle”. This has proven quite inconvenient for both users and those trying to support them. Mike reports progress on “unifying the pluggable transport bundles with the official bundles, so that both censored and uncensored users can use the same bundles. […] The progress is sufficient that we are very likely to be able to deploy a 3.6-beta1 release in February to test these unified bundles.”</p>\n<p>Another important topic is how the privacy fixes in the Tor Browser can benefit a wider userbase.  The team has “continued the merge process with Mozilla, and have worked to ensure that every patch of ours is on their radar […]. Two patches, one for an API we require to manage the Tor subprocess, and another to give us a filter to remove potentially dangerous drag-and-drop events to the desktop have already been merged. Next steps will include filing more bugs, continual contact with their development team, and touching up patches as needed.”</p>\n<p>There are even more things to smile about in the report. Read it in full for the whole picture.</p>\n<h1>Key revocation in next generation hidden services</h1>\n<p>It looks like every <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_infrastructure\">public-key infrastructure</a> struggles with how to handle key revocation. Hidden services are no different. The current design completely ignored preventing a stolen key from being reused by an attacker.</p>\n<p>With the on-going effort to create a <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt\">new protocol for hidden services</a>, now seems to be a good time for George Kadianakis to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006146.html\">raise this issue</a>. In the past there was little control for the hidden services operators over their secret key. The new design enables offline management operations which include key revocation.</p>\n<p>As George puts it, currently well-known solutions “are always messy and don’t work really well (look at SSL’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Certificate_Status_Protocol\">OCSP</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_revocation_list\">CRLs</a>).” So how can “the legitimate Hidden Service can inform a client that its keys got compromised”?</p>\n<p>In his email, George describes two solutions, one relying on the directory authorities, the other on hidden service directories.  Both have drawbacks, so perhaps further research is necessary.</p>\n<p>In the same thread, Nick Hopper <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006149.html\">suggested</a> a scheme that uses multiple hidden service directories to cross-certify their revocation lists. This gives more confidence to the user, since the adversary now has to compromise multiple hidden service directories.</p>\n<p>Please join the discussion if you have ideas to share!</p>\n<h1>Help needed to remove DNS leaks from Mumble</h1>\n<p><a href=\"http://mumble.sourceforge.net/\">Mumble</a> is a “low-latency, high quality voice chat software primarily intended for use while gaming”.</p>\n<p>It’s proven to be a reliable solution for voice chat among multiple parties over Tor. Matt and Colin have worked on a documentation on how to <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO/Mumble\">setup both the client and the server side</a> for Tor users.<br />\nBut the client is currently safely usable only on Linux system with torsocks and on Tails. On other operating systems, the Mumble client will unfortunately <a href=\"https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues/1033\">leak the address of the server to the local DNS resolver</a>.</p>\n<p>The changes that need to be made to the Mumble code are less trivial than one would think. Matt describe the issue in more details in his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006158.html\">call for help</a>. Have a look if you are up to some C++/Qt hacking.</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for January 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of January has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-January/000435.html\">Damian Johnson</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-January/000436.html\">Philipp Winter</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000437.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000438.html\">Tor Browser team</a> from Mike Perry, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000439.html\">Colin C.</a>, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000440.html\">help desk</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000441.html\">Matt</a>. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000442.html\">Lunar</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000443.html\">George Kadianakis</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000445.html\">Pearl Crescent</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006157.html\">came up</a> with <a href=\"https://github.com/nmathewson/mmdb-convert\">a Python script</a> to convert the new MaxMind GeoIP2 binary database to the format used by Tor for its geolocation database.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-February/000464.html\">John Ricketts from Quintex Alliance Consulting</a> for providing another mirror for the Tor Project’s website and software.</p>\n<p>Abhiram Chintangal and Oliver Baumann are <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006142.html\">reporting</a> progress on their <a href=\"https://github.com/baumanno/tor-weather-rewrite\">rewrite</a> of the Tor Weather service.</p>\n<p>Andreas Jonsson gave <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031959.html\">an update</a> on how Mozilla is moving to a <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=925570\">multi-process model for Firefox</a> and how this should positively affect the possibility of sandboxing the Tor Browser in the future.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006061.html\">planned</a>, to help “developers to analyze the directory protocol and for researchers to understand what information is available to clients to make path selection decisions”, Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006141.html\">has made</a> microdescriptor archives available on the metrics website.</p>\n<p>Christian has <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032012.html\">deployed</a> a <a href=\"https://globe-node.herokuapp.com/\">test platform</a> for the JavaScript-less version of Globe, a tool to retrieve information about the Tor network and its relays.</p>\n<p>In an answer to Shadowman’s questions about pluggable transports, George Kadianakis wrote a detailed reply on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031984.html\">how Tor manages pluggable transports</a>, both on the server side an on the client side.</p>\n<p>Arthur D. Edelstein has <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032010.html\">advertised a GreaseMonkey script</a> to enable Tor Browser to access YouTube videos without having JavaScript enabled. Please be aware of the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-January/031623.html\">security risks that GreaseMonkey might introduce</a> before using such a solution.</p>\n<p>Andrew Lewman reports on his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-January/000434.html\">trip to Washington DC</a> where he met Spitfire Strategies to learn about “Tor’s brand, media presence, and ideas for the future”. For a short excerpt: “It’s interesting to get critiques on all our past media appearances; what was good and what could be better. Overall, the team there are doing a great job.”</p>\n<p>Lunar <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000444.html\">accounted</a> for Tor’s presence at FOSDEM, one of the largest free software event in Europe. The project had a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/anthraxx42/status/429600652399247361\">small booth</a> shared with Mozilla and there was even a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FrennVunDerEnn/status/429636610603233280\">relay operator meetup</a>.</p>\n<p>Yan Zhu has <a href=\"https://lists.eff.org/pipermail/https-everywhere/2014-February/001964.html\">released</a> the first version of HTTPS Everywhere for Firefox Mobile. A good news for users of <a href=\"https://github.com/guardianproject/Orfox\">the upcoming Orfox</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Users often want to know if Tor can make them appear to be coming from a particular country. Although doing so can reduce one’s anonymity, it is <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#ChooseEntryExit\">documented on our FAQ page</a>.</p>\n<p>Orbot users have noticed that installing Orbot to their SD storage can cause Orbot to stop functioning correctly. Installing Orbot to the internal storage has resolved issues for a few users.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>Rhin is <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1402/88\">looking for hidden services hosting services</a>. Jens pointed them to ahmia.fi but it looks like no there are no gratis hidden services hosters currently available.</p>\n<p>Vijay kudal wanted to know how to <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1438/1041\">change the current circuit within shell scripts</a>. Jens Kubieziel gave an <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/a/1453/88\">answer using expect and hexdump</a>.</p>\n<p>Roya saw <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1439/88\">check.torproject.org replying contradictory information</a> with Atlas about the exit node being used.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the sixth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tails 0.22.1 is out</h1>\n<p>The Tails team cut its 36th release on February 4th. Their Debian-based live operating system continues to provide anonymity by ensuring that all outgoing connections are routed through Tor, and privacy by ensuring that no traces are left without the user’s knowledge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.22.1/\">Tails 0.22.1</a> contains <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.22/\">security fixes</a> to Firefox, NSS, and Pidgin. It also brings an updated Linux kernel and several fixes for regressions and small issues.</p>\n<p>While advertised as a minor version, the new incremental upgrades are a major usability improvement. Previously, upgrading Tails basically meant installing Tails again by downloading the image and putting it on a DVD or a USB stick. Users who store persistent data in their Tails instance then had to use this new medium to upgrade the stick with their data. A tedious process, to say the least. Now, with incremental upgrades, Tails users with USB sticks will be prompted to perform a few clicks, wait, and reboot to get their system up-to-date.</p>\n<p>One usability change might surprise long time Tails users: the browser now has to be manually opened when Tor has successfully reached the network.</p>\n<p>As always, be sure to <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/upgrade/\">upgrade</a>! Users of Tails 0.22 on USB sticks can do so easily by running the <em>Tails Upgrader</em> application in the <em>Tails</em> menu.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser Bundle 3.5.2 is released</h1>\n<p>The Tor Browser team delivers a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-352-released\">new Tor Browser Bundle</a>. Version 3.5.2 brings Tor users <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.3\">important security fixes from Firefox</a> and contains fixes to the “new identity” feature, window size rounding, and the welcome screen with right-to-left language, among others.</p>\n<p>The curious can take a peek at the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/blob/a1bab4013e:/Bundle-Data/Docs/ChangeLog.txt\">changelog</a> for more details. Every Tor user is encouraged to upgrade as soon possible. Jump to the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html\">download page</a>!</p>\n<h1>Call to bridge operators to deploy ScrambleSuit</h1>\n<p>In the beginning there was Tor. When censors started filtering every known relay address, <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/125-bridges.txt\">bridges</a> were invented as a way to access the Tor network through unlisted relays. Deep packet inspection systems then started to filter Tor based on its traffic signature, so <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/pt-spec.txt\">pluggable transports</a> and obfucation protocols were designed in order to prevent bridge detection.</p>\n<p>Currently, obfuscation is achieved through “obfs2” and “obfs3”. obfs2 is flawed; it’s detectable by deep packet inspection and is being phased out. obfs3 is unfortunately still vulnerable to active probing attacks. As obfs3 bridges are open to anyone, an attacker who uses a traffic classifier and finds an unclassified connection can figure out if it’s Tor simply by trying to connect through the same destination.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/\">ScrambleSuit</a> comes to the rescue. On top of making the traffic harder to recognize by timing or volume characteristics, ScrambleSuit requires a shared secret between the bridge and the client. A censor looking at the connection won’t have this secret, and therefore be unable to connect to the bridge and confirm that it’s Tor.</p>\n<p>obfsproxy 0.2.6 was <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/commit/a3b43d475c4172\">released last week</a> and adds ScrambleSuit to the set of available pluggable transports. Bridge operators are now <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003886.html\">called</a> to update their software and configuration. At least Tor 0.2.5.1-alpha is required. The latest version of obfsproxy can be installed from <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git\">source</a>, <a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/obfsproxy\">pip</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003894.html\">Debian unstable</a>.</p>\n<p>There must be a critical mass of bridges before ScrambleSuit is made available to the Tor users who need it, so please help!</p>\n<h1>More status reports for January 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of January continued. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000446.html\">Kevin P Dyer</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000447.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000448.html\">Georg Koppen</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000449.html\">Karsten Loesing</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000450.html\">Jacob Appelbaum</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000451.html\">Arturo Filastò</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000452.html\">Isis Lovecruft</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000453.html\">Nicolas Vigier</a> all released their reports this week.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine has also sent the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000454.html\">report</a> to SponsorF.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Most Tor developers will gather next week in Reykjavík, Iceland for the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting\">2014 winter meeting</a>. Expect a drop in activity on the usual communication channels while everyone is busy with face-to-face conversations. See <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/events/tors-winter-2014-developers-meeting-reykjavik-iceland\">upcoming events</a> for activities open to the larger Tor community.</p>\n<p>David Fifield is <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-February/000324.html\">looking for testers</a> for experimental 3.5.2 browser bundles with tor-fw-helper. “tor-fw-helper is a tool that uses UPnP or NAT-PMP to forward a port automatically” — something that <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/\">flashproxy</a> requires. David is “interested in finding out how likely it is to work”.</p>\n<p>David Goulet gave us an <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006172.html\">update on the development of Torsocks 2.x</a>. He hopes to perform a “full on release” after the Tor developers meeting.</p>\n<p>”The Trying Trusted Tor Traceroutes project is coming closer to the next data review (03/2014)” <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003865.html\">wrote</a> Sebastian Urbach. If you are a relay operator, please help find out how Tor performs against network-level attackers. The team now has a <a href=\"http://datarepo.cs.illinois.edu/relay_scoreboard.html\">scoreboard</a> with feedback for the participants.</p>\n<p>One relay started to act funny regarding its advertised bandwidth. Roger Dingledine quickly <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032094.html\">reported his worries</a> to the tor-talk mailing list. A couple of hours later Hyoung-Kee Choi <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032096.html\">accounted</a> that one of the students from his research group had made a mistake while experimenting on the Tor bandwidth scanner. Directory authorities are now restricting its usage in the consensus.</p>\n<p>On February 11th, the Tor Project participated on <a href=\"https://thedaywefightback.org/\">The Day We Fight Back</a>, a global day of mobilization against NSA mass surveillance.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Tor supporters are often curious about the legal risks involved in running a Tor relay. The Tor Project is not aware of any country where running Tor is a punishable offense. Running a bridge relay or a non-exit relay is the best way to grow the Tor network without being exposed to additional legal scrutiny. The decision to run an exit relay should be made only after carefully reviewing the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/running-exit-node\">best practices</a>. Unlike non-exit and bridge operators, exit relay operators need to be prepared to respond to abuse complaints.</p>\n<p>Users continue to express interest in a 64-bit Tor Browser Bundle for Windows. Work to provide this new variant is <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10026\">on-going</a>.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>strugee is running a Fast, Running and Valid relay and wonders <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1485/88\">when the relay will get the V2Dir flag</a>. weasel answered that relays should “get the V2Dir flag simply by publishing a DirPort”, but that Tor will not always publish a DirPort: the full list can be found in the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/tor-0.2.4.20:/src/or/router.c#l1018\">source code</a>.</p>\n<p>Ivar noted that the site <a href=\"https://www.howsmyssl.com/\">How’s my SSL</a> thinks that the SSL configuration of the Tor Browser is bad and wondered <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1455/88\">how the situation could be improved</a>. Jens Kubieziel explained some settings for about:config and pointed to a <a href=\"http://kubieziel.de/blog/archives/1564-Using-SSL-securely-in-your-browser.html\">more detailed blog post</a>. Sam Whited also pointed out some settings for Firefox and noted that Firefox 27 <a href=\"https://blog.samwhited.com/2014/01/fixing-tls-in-firefox/\">improved the rating to “probably good”</a> which will help the Tor Browser in the future.</p>\n<p>fred set up a relay on a Windows machine where µTorrent is used besides Tor.  When Tor is enabled many trackers become unreachable, but come back as soon as the relay is disabled. An <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1243/88\">explanation to this behaviour</a> has yet to be found, don’t hesitate to chime in.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, Matt Pagan, Paul Feitzinger, qbi, Roger Dingledine and Karsten Loesing.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the seventh issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the <a href=\"http://redd.it/1y5y49\">inked</a> Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor 0.2.5.2-alpha is out</h1>\n<p>Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032150.html\">announced</a> the second alpha release in the Tor 0.2.5 series. As well as incorporating “all the fixes from 0.2.4.18-rc and 0.2.4.20, like the “poor random number generation” fix and the “building too many circuits” fix”, this release brings with it several new features of its own, among them the forced inclusion of at least one relay capable of the NTor handshake in every three-hop circuit, which should reduce the chance “that we’re building a circuit that’s worth attacking by an adversary who finds breaking 1024-bit crypto doable”, as Roger wrote.</p>\n<p>You can read the full changelog in Roger’s announcement, and download the new release from <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">the Tor Project website</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser 3.5.2.1 is released</h1>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-3521-released\">new point release of the Tor Browser Bundle was put out</a> on February 15th. A change in how Mozilla tags Firefox releases <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10895\">broke the localization</a> of the browser interface. This release restores proper behavior for languages other than English.</p>\n<p>Apart from the localization fix and the removal of unneeded libraries from the Windows bundles, no other changes have been made.</p>\n<h1>Help draft a proposal for partnership with the Wikimedia Foundation</h1>\n<p>The relationship between Tor users and the Wikimedia Foundation, which operates Wikipedia and related projects, is currently not as good as it could be: many Tor users feel they should be able to contribute to Wikipedia anonymously, while many Wikipedia editors are wary of dealing with a tool that could enable untraceable or unblockable vandalism of pages and articles.</p>\n<p>As a prelude to resolving this conflict, Lane Rasberry has <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/Partnership_between_Wikimedia_community_and_Tor_community\">opened a discussion</a> on the Wikimedia Foundation’s IdeaLab, a forum in which ideas can be discussed and debated before being collaboratively developed into full grant proposals. As Lane wrote, “persons using Tor (the anonymity network) should be able to create Wikipedia accounts and contribute to Wikipedia while logged into those accounts. Some technical problems currently disallow this and some social problems prevent the technical problems from being addressed. Anyone with a proposal of what kind of relationship Tor and the Wikimedia movement should have should describe it here.”</p>\n<p>If you are interested in helping to resolve this issue, please see the IdeaLab page, and add your comments!</p>\n<h1>Only as good as your weakest transport?</h1>\n<p>Delton Barnes <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003906.html\">pointed out</a> that although the ScrambleSuit pluggable transport protocol includes a certain amount of protection against active probing for bridges by censorship systems like the Chinese “Great Firewall”, bridge operators who run more vulnerable protocols like obfs3 alongside ScrambleSuit may be increasing the risk that censors will discover their relay and block connections to it of any kind.</p>\n<p>In reply, Philipp Winter <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003907.html\">conceded</a> that although the Chinese censorship system currently seems to block bridges by IP:port tuples, rather than by IP address alone, the mere presence of an easily-discoverable pluggable transport protocol (or a public relay) on a given machine makes it more likely that a censor will be motivated to try and defeat protections such as those offered by ScrambleSuit. “So you are right, only running ScrambleSuit gives your bridge more protection than running other protocols at the same time — at the cost of attracting less users, however”, he concluded.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>The Tails team has published <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2014_01/\">its report for January 2014</a>. A lot is happening in the growing community of Tails developers. Have a look!</p>\n<p>Qingping Hou sent out the beginnings of a proposal to increase the speed of connections to Tor Hidden Services by using circuits of only five hops, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006198.html\">asked the community for feedback</a>.</p>\n<p>Yawning Angel called for help with testing obfsclient, a C++ pluggable transport client, and clarified the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006211.html\">next steps in the development process</a>.</p>\n<p>David Fifield <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-February/000338.html\">made available a second updated set of the experimental Tor Pluggable Transport Bundle with tor-fw-helper</a>, which fixes several of the errors encountered in the first version.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006230.html\">called for help with reviewing proposal 227</a>, which involves “extending the Tor consensus document to include digests of the latest versions of one or more package files, to allow software using Tor to determine its up-to-dateness, and help users verify that they are getting the correct software”.</p>\n<p>Efforts to include the FTE protocol in the Tor Pluggable Transport Bundles have taken a step forward, as Kevin P. Dyer <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006223.html\">announced</a> the release of a patch including fteproxy that not only works, but also builds deterministically, in keeping with the Tor Project’s focus on <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise\">build security</a>.</p>\n<p>Rusty Bird <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032152.html\">announced</a> the release of <a href=\"https://github.com/rustybird/corridor\">corridor</a>, a Tor traffic whitelisting gateway. corridor will turn a Linux system into a router that “allows only connections to Tor relays to pass through (no clearnet leaks!)”. However, unlike transparent proxying solutions, “client computers are themselves responsible for torifying their own traffic.”</p>\n<p>One relay operator was looking for an <code>init.d</code> script able to start multiple tor instances. Johannes Fürmann <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003915.html\">pointed out</a> that one was <a href=\"https://github.com/torservers/setup-automation/blob/master/config/initd-tor\">available in the torservers.net Git repository</a>.</p>\n<p>TorBirdy, the Tor-enabling extension for the Thunderbird mail client, currently disables the automated account configuration system for security reasons. <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/1083\">Progress is being made</a> in changing the behavior to make it fit the expectations of Tor users.</p>\n<p>Andrea Shepard submitted seven status reports, covering her activity since July 2013 (<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000455.html\">July</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000456.html\">August</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000457.html\">September</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000458.html\">October</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000459.html\">November</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000460.html\">December</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000461.html\">January</a>).</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Users often ask for help updating their Tor Browser Bundle. Some users download and try to run their new Tor Browser without first closing their current Tor Browser. This causes an error message, since Tor is already running. The Tor Browser Bundle update is not an upgrade that can be applied while Tor Browser is still running.

This year, close to forty people attended the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting\">2014 winter dev. meeting</a>, which was held in Reykjavík, Iceland.</p>\n<p>The team discussed over forty topics ranging from organizational matters to highly technical design decisions. Among the highlights: many sessions were focused on discussing and producing roadmaps — <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/TorBrowserPlan\">a mid-term vision for the Tor Browser</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/RoadmapTIMB\">a step-by-step plan for the Tor Instant Messaging Bundle</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/BridgeBundles\">detailed ideas for new bridge bundles</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/GuardDesign\">ways to solve the research problems around guard nodes</a>, and <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/TorReleaseProcess\">how to plan little-t tor releases</a>.</p>\n<p>The meeting also enabled cross-team communication: pluggable transports developers were able to <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/PTTBB\">discuss integration into the Tor Browser</a> and the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/BridgeProtocolsAndTBB\">lifecycle of recommended transports</a>, while the Tor Browser group and the support teams met to see how to <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/SupportAndTorBrowserTeamsMeeting\">improve communications on both sides</a>. One outcome is a plan to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10974\">remix existing documentation to create the Tor Browser User Manual</a>.</p>\n<p>Two days of intense discussion were followed by hands-on sessions which saw their <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/timeline?from=Feb+21%2C+2014&amp;daysback=2&amp;authors=&amp;ticket=on&amp;ticket_details=on&amp;changeset=on&amp;wiki=on&amp;update=Update\">fair share of hacking and write-ups</a>.</p>\n<p>Some of the minutes are still missing, but there is already plenty to read. Now that the developers have had to stop contemplating the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy)\">Northern Lights</a>, some <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006288.html\">discussions</a> are already continuing on the project’s various mailing lists. Stay tuned!</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Karsten Loesing  <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006299.html\">announced</a> an IRC meeting to discuss the next steps for the rewrite of Tor Weather, to be held on the OFTC #tor-dev channel on Wednesday 26th February at 18:00 UTC. “Topics include reporting progress made since the last meeting two weeks ago, making plans for the next week, and possibly turning this project into a GSoC project”.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006282.html\">announced</a> the start of a weekly Tor developer’s meeting, to be held on the OFTC #tor-dev channel, “for working on the program ‘tor’. (This won’t cover all the other programs developed under the Tor umbrella.)” .</p>\n<p>The Tails developers <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-February/004934.html\">will be holding</a> their next contributors’ meeting on the OFTC #tails-dev channel at 9pm UTC on March 5th; “everyone interested in contributing to Tails is welcome.” .</p>\n<p>Andrew Lewman submitted his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000462.html\">monthly status report for January</a>, and also wrote up a report of his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000463.html\">involvement in the recent Boston CryptoParty</a>.</p>\n<p>Alexander Dietrich <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003942.html\">published</a> a multi-instance init script for Tor (“basically the current official init script and torservers.net’s “instances” mechanism frankensteined together”, in Alexander’s words) in response to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003913.html\">a recent discussion on tor-relays</a>.</p>\n<p>Responding to a message from someone interested in writing a DNS-based pluggable transport, George Kadianakis <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006250.html\">suggested</a> several ways in which the existing obfsproxy code could be reworked to accommodate this.</p>\n<p>George also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003951.html\">recommended</a> that operators of obfs3 or ScrambleSuit bridges install the python-gmpy package on their relays, as it can significantly increase the speed of some cryptographic operations.</p>\n<p>Jens Kubieziel <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006260.html\">wrote up</a> the results of an attempt to determine whether the recent transition between the TAP and NTor handshake protocols is connected to some users’ reports of hidden service unavailability.</p>\n<p>Max Jakob Maass <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032173.html\">published</a> the preliminary results of a test in which the RIPE Atlas measurement API was used to retrieve the SSL certificate of torproject.org from as many countries as possible in order to detect attempted attacks or censorship, and wondered whether it might be worth running such a test on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>With regard to a coming redesign of the “Volunteers” section on the Tor Project’s website, Moritz Bartl wrote up a list of proposed volunteer categories that was the fruit of a brainstorming session at the Tor developers’ meeting, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032176.html\">asked for suggestions</a> of “obvious” missing sections, as well as “acceptably-licensed” graphics that could serve as icons for each category .</p>\n<p>Nathan Freitas <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032174.html\">wrote</a> from the Tor developers’ meeting with a request for help in compiling “<a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014WinterDevMeeting/notes/UserStories\">user stories</a>” on the Tor wiki: that is, stories of the form “a <em>type of Tor user</em> wants to <em>some feature of a Tor app</em> in order to <em>some reason related to security, privacy, etc</em>”. If you have any to add, please write them up on the dedicated wiki page!</p>\n<p>Yawning Angel <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006300.html\">sent out</a> a draft of a proposal to “extend the SOCKS5 protocol when communicating with pluggable transports to allow passing more per-bridge meta-data to the transport and returning more meaningful connection failure response codes back to Tor”.</p>\n<p>Josh Ayers <a href=\"http://opensource.dyc.edu/pipermail/tor-ramdisk/2014-February/000119.html\">wrote</a> to the Tor-ramdisk list suggesting possible ways to ensure that sufficient entropy is available to the kernel by the time tor-ramdisk generates its long-term keys.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>A common question the help desk receives is how to respond to the Tor Browser Bundle’s download warning message. The message indicates that the Tor Browser Bundle only routes browser traffic through Tor, not traffic from any other application. For example, a PDF file that connects automatically to a URL will not route its traffic through Tor if the file is opened with an external application. An <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/7439\">open bug ticket</a> for improving this warning message has more information about the issue.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by harmony, Lunar, Matt Pagan, Nicolas Vigier, Roger Dingledine, and George Kadianakis.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the ninth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor 0.2.4.21 is out</h1>\n<p>Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032242.html\">announced the release of Tor 0.2.4.21</a>, whose major new feature is the forced inclusion of at least one NTor-capable relay in any given three-hop circuit as a defence against adversaries who might be able to break 1024-bit encryption; this feature was first seen in the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032150.html\">latest alpha release</a> (0.2.5.2-alpha) three weeks ago, but is here incorporated into the current stable series.</p>\n<p>You can find full details of this release’s other features and bugfixes in Roger’s announcement.</p>\n<h1>Tor in Google Summer of Code 2014</h1>\n<p>As has been the case over the past several years, Tor will once again <a href=\"https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2014/tor\">be participating</a> in Google’s annual Summer of Code program — aspiring software developers have the chance to work on a Tor-related project with financial assistance from Google and expert guidance from a core Tor Project member. Several prospective students have already contacted the community with questions about the program, and Damian Johnson took to the Tor Blog to give a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-google-summer-code-2014\">brief summary of what students can expect from the Summer of Code</a>, and what the Tor Project expects from its students.</p>\n<p>In particular, Damian encouraged potential applicants to discuss their ideas with the community on the tor-dev mailing list or IRC channel before submitting an application: “Communication is essential to success in the summer of code, and we’re unlikely to accept students we haven’t heard from before reading their application.”</p>\n<p>If you are hoping to contribute to Tor as part of the Summer of Code program, please have a look through Damian’s advice and then, as he says, “come to the list or IRC channel and talk to us!”</p>\n<h1>Two ways to help with Tails development</h1>\n<p>One of the most interesting upcoming additions to the Tails operating system is the ability to thwart attempts at tracking the movements of network-enabled devices by spoofing the MAC address on each boot.  As part of the testing process for this new feature, the Tails developers have <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/spoof-mac/\">released</a> an experimental disk image which turns it on by default, alongside a step-by-step guide to trying it out and reporting any issues encountered. However, as the developers state, “this is a test image. Do not use it for anything other than testing this feature.” If you are willing to take note of this caveat, please feel free to download the test image and let the community know what you find.</p>\n<p>Turning to the longer-term development of the project, the team also published a detailed set of guidelines for anyone who wants to help <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/contribute/how/debian/\">improve Tails itself by contributing to the development of Debian</a>, the operating system on which Tails is based. They include advice on the relationship between the two distributions, tasks in need of attention, and channels for discussing issues with the Tails community; if you are keen on the idea of helping two free-software projects at one stroke, please have a look!</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for February 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of February has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000464.html\">Georg Koppen</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000465.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000466.html\">Pearl Crescent</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-February/000467.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000468.html\">Colin C.</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000471.html\">Lunar</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000472.html\">Kelley Misata</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000474.html\">Damian Johnson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000475.html\">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000476.html\">Philipp Winter</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000478.html\">Karsten Loesing</a>.</p>\n<p>Lunar also reported on behalf of <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000469.html\">the help desk</a>, while Mike Perry did the same on behalf of <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000473.html\">the Tor Browser team </a>, and Arturo Filastò for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000477.html\">the OONI team</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Members of the Prosecco research team released a <a href=\"https://secure-resumption.com/\">new attack on the TLS protocol</a> — dubbed “Triple Handshake” — allowing impersonation of a given client when client authentication is in use together with session resumption and renegotiation. Nick Mathewson published a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006372.html\">detailed analysis of why Tor is not affected</a>, and also outlines future changes to make Tor resistant to even more potential TLS issues.</p>\n<p>Mike Perry <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tbb-dev/2014-February/000000.html\">announced</a> the start of a weekly Tor Browser developer’s meeting, to be held on <code>#tor-dev</code> on <code>irc.oftc.net</code>. These meetings are tentatively scheduled for 19:00 UTC on Wednesdays. Details on the format and flow of the meetings can be found on the tor-dev and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tbb-dev\">tbb-dev</a> mailing lists.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson were among the signatories of an <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/02/open-letter-to-tech-companies\">open letter</a> published by the EFF which offers ten principles for technology companies to follow in protecting users from illegal surveillance.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006341.html\">detailed</a> a change in the way that the core Tor development team will use the bugtracker’s “milestone” feature to separate tickets marked for resolution in a given Tor version from those that can be deferred to a later release.</p>\n<p>Nick then sent out the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006342.html\">latest in his irregular series of Tor proposal status updates</a>, containing summaries of each open proposal, guidance for reviewers, and notes for further work. If you'd like to help Tor’s development by working on one of these proposals, start here!</p>\n<p>On the subject of proposals, two new ones were sent to the tor-dev list for review: <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006304.html\">proposal 228</a>, which offers a way for relays to prove ownership of their onion keys as well as their identity key, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006340.html\">proposal 229</a> based on Yawning Angel’s unnumbered submission from last week, which concerns improvements to the SOCKS5 protocol for communication between clients, Tor, and pluggable transports.</p>\n<p>Nicholas Merrill <a href=\"https://mailman.stanford.edu/pipermail/liberationtech/2014-February/013041.html\">wrote</a> to the Liberationtech list to announce that xmpp.net now lists <a href=\"https://xmpp.net/reports.php#onions\">XMPP servers that are reachable over hidden services</a>, and that xmpp.net’s server scanner works with these as well.</p>\n<p>Patrick Schleizer <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032227.html\">announced</a> the release of version 8 of <a href=\"https://www.whonix.org/\">Whonix</a> — an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and security based on the Tor anonymity network, Debian and security by isolation. The curious should take a look at the long changelog.</p>\n<p>Kelley Misata wrote up an <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000470.html\">account</a> of her talk “Journalists — Staying Safe in a Digital World”, which she delivered at the Computer-Assisted Reporting Conference in Baltimore.</p>\n<p>Having co-authored <a href=\"http://petsymposium.org/2012/papers/hotpets12-1-usability.pdf\">a paper in 2012 on usability issues connected with<br />\nthe Tor Browser Bundle</a>, Greg Norcie <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032205.html\">drew attention</a> to a follow-up study named <a href=\"http://www.norcie.com/papers/torUSEC.pdf\">Why Johnny Can’t Blow the Whistle</a>,  which focuses on verifying the conclusions of the earlier tests while exploring a number of other possible usability improvements. The study was, however, carried out before the release of Tor Browser version 3, which improved the bundle’s usability based on earlier suggestions.</p>\n<p>Mac OS X users will be thrilled to learn that the next Tor Browser Bundle will be <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/images/TBBDMG.png\">shipped as a DMG (disk image)</a> instead of the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/4261\">previous unusual .ZIP archive</a>.</p>\n<p>David Rajchenbach-Teller from Mozilla <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032204.html\">reached out</a> to the Tor Browser developers about their overhaul of the Firefox Session Restore mechanism. This is another milestone in the growing collaboration between the Tor Project and Mozilla.</p>\n<p>On the “anonymity is hard” front, David Fifield <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10703\">reported</a> a fingerprinting issue on the Tor Browser. Fallback charsets can be used to learn the user locale as they vary from one to another. The next release of the Tor Browser will use “windows-1252” for all locales, as this matches the impersonated “User-Agent” string (Firefox — English version — on Windows) that it already sends in its HTTP headers.</p>\n<p>Yawning Angel <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006358.html\">called for help</a> in testing and reviewing obfsclient-0.0.1rc2, the second obfsclient release candidate this week: “assuming nothing is broken, this will most likely become v0.0.1, though I may end up disabling Session Ticket handshakes.”</p>\n<p>David Fifield <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006356.html\">published</a> a guide to patching meek, an HTTP pluggable transport, so that it can be used to send traffic via <a href=\"https://www.getlantern.org/\">Lantern</a>, a censorship circumvention system which “acts as an HTTP proxy and proxies your traffic through trusted friends.”</p>\n<p>Fortasse <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-February/032220.html\">started a discussion</a> on tor-talk about using HTTPS Everywhere to redirect Tor Browser users to .onion addresses when available. Several people commented regarding the procedure, its security, or how it could turn the Tor Project or the EFF into some kind of registrar.</p>\n<p>anonym <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-February/005023.html\">has been busy</a> adapting the configuration interface from the Tor Browser — called “Tor Launcher” — to Tails’ needs. Preliminary results can already be seen in the <a href=\"http://nightly.tails.boum.org/build_Tails_ISO_experimental/\">images built from the experimental branch</a>.</p>\n<p>Ramo <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-March/004007.html\">wrote</a> to announce their <a href=\"https://github.com/goodvikings/tor_nagios/\">Nagios plugin project</a> to the relay operator community. Lunar pointed out a complementary probe named<br />\n<a href=\"http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=users/lunar/check_tor.git;a=blob;f=README;hb=HEAD\">check_tor.py</a>.</p>\n<p>Virgil Griffith sent a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-February/006344.html\">draft proposal</a> for changes to improve the latency of hidden services when using the “Tor2web” mode. Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006347.html\">commented</a> that one of the proposed changes actually opened a new research question regarding the actual latency benefits.</p>\n<p>David Goulet released the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006371.html\">fourth candidate of his Torsocks rewrite</a>. This new version comes after “a big code review from Nick and help from a lot of people contributing and testing”. But more reviews and testing are now welcome!</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Often users email the help desk when the Tor Browser’s Tor client fails somehow. There are many ways for the Tor Browser to fail in such a way that the Tor log is inaccessible. Since antivirus programs, firewalls, system clock skew, proxied internet connections, and internet censorship have all been known to cause Tor failures, it is not always easy to determine the source of the problem.  Thankfully, the Tor Browser team is working on making the logs easier to access in case of failures (<a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10059\">#10059</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10603\">#10603</a>).</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>Janice needs to be able to connect from an IP address in a specific city and wanted to know if <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1485/88\">Tor can be used to do so</a>. Several users suggested that this is not possible with Tor. For city-level IP addresses, it might better to use other services like a proxy or a tunnel, provided one does not require anonymity.</p>\n<p>The Tor Browser Bundle sets the default font to Times New Roman 16pt and allows pages to use their own fonts. User joeb likes to change the settings and wondered <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1619/88\">how this increases the possibility to fingerprint a user</a>. gacar suggested that this will facilitate fingerprinting attacks. Several important sites use <a href=\"https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/fpdetective/#results\">font probing to fingerprint their users</a>, and changing the default fonts is likely to make a user stand out from the common anonymity set.</p>\n<p>Kristopher Ives <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1598/88\">wondered</a> if Tor uses some kind of compression. Several users <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git?a=search&amp;h=HEAD&amp;st=grep&amp;s=gzip\">searched the source code archives for “gzip”</a> and found code which deals with directory information. Jens Kubieziel argued that Tor operates on encrypted data and compressing encrypted data usually results in a increase in size, so it makes no sense to compress this data.</p>\n<p>Stackexchange uses bounties to award higher reputations to answers. By using this one can attract attention and get better answers or an answer at all. The question about <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1503/88\">using DNSSEC and DNScrypt over Tor</a> is probably the first to receive a bounty: an answer to this question would be rewarded with 50 points. However, they have not been earned yet, so if you know an answer, please enlighten the rest of the community.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by harmony, Lunar, qbi, Matt Pagan, Karsten Loesing, Mike Perry, dope457, and Philipp Winter.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

Basile <a href=\"http://opensource.dyc.edu/pipermail/tor-ramdisk/2014-March/000127.html\">released</a> a new version of <a href=\"http://opensource.dyc.edu/tor-ramdisk\">tor-ramdisk</a>. Tor-ramdisk is a “micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that maximizes security and privacy. Security is enhanced by hardening the kernel and binaries, and privacy is enhanced by forcing logging to be off at all levels so that even the Tor operator only has access to minimal information. Finally, since everything runs in ephemeral memory, no information survives a reboot […].”</p>\n<p>The new version contains Tor 0.2.4.21 and an updated kernel. The main change is the addition of “haveged, a daemon to help generate entropy on diskless systems, for a more cryptographically sound system”.</p>\n<h1>Tails launches a logo contest</h1>\n<p>Do you want to design a piece of artwork that might be seen by hundreds of thousands of people every day? A drawing that will appear on websites, t-shirts, stickers, and software that protects anonymity and privacy?</p>\n<p>Tails is starting a <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/logo_contest/\">logo contest</a> to “give Tails the visual impact it deserves”. Designers have a precise list of requirements to follow that was drawn from past discussions amongst Tails developers. Participants should submit a version of the logo that incorporates the word “Tails” as well as one without text; there is also a list of suggestions for complementary material that would be welcome.</p>\n<p>As the Tails team wants to have the logo ready for its upcoming 1.0 release, designers have until March 31st to send their submission. Be quick!</p>\n<h1>More status reports for February 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of February continued, with <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000479.html\">Isis Lovecruft</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000480.html\">Andrew Lewman</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000482.html\">Matt Pagan</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000483.html\">Kevin P. Dyer</a> releasing their reports this week.</p>\n<p>The Tails developers also <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2014_02/\">reported on their recent progress</a>, and Roger Dingledine sent out the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000484.html\">report for SponsorF</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Tails issued the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/test_0.23-rc1/\">call for testing for its 0.23 release</a>. At the very least, the long awaited features that are MAC spoofing and bridge integration would benefit from wider testing.

Jens Kubieziel explained that OR connections are those between two relays or between a client and a relay. While this config option can be used to proxy outgoing OR connections from a relay, it won’t proxy exit streams, and also the relay still needs to be reachable on its advertised ORPort, so it is simplest to say that no, it can’t be used to run a relay over a SOCKS proxy.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, harmony, Matt Pagan, qbi and Roger Dingledine.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Recently somebody asked me why our usage numbers in China are so low. More precisely, his question was \"How do I read <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=userstats-bridge-country&amp;start=2011-10-18&amp;end=2014-01-16&amp;country=cn#userstats-bridge-country\">this graph</a> in any way other than 'Tor is effectively blocked in China'?\" After writing up an answer for him, I realized I should share it with the rest of the Tor community too.</p>\n<p>The correct interpretation of the graph is \"obfs3 bridges have not been deployed enough to keep up with the demand in China\". So it isn't that Tor is blocked &mdash; it's that we haven't done much of a deployment for obfs3 bridges or ScrambleSuit bridges, which are the latest steps in the arms race.</p>\n<p>The short explanation is that <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/blocking.html#sec:network-fingerprint\">the old vanilla SSL Tor transport</a> doesn't work in China anymore due to their <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#foci12-winter\"> active probing infrastructure</a>.  The <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs2/obfs2-protocol-spec.txt\">obfs2 transport</a> doesn't work anymore either, for the same reason. The <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt\">obfs3 transport</a> works great for now, and thousands of people are happily using it &mdash; and some of those people aren't reflected in the graphs you see (I'll explain that more below).</p>\n<p>The medium-length explanation is that we've been leading and coordinating the international research effort at understanding how to design and analyze <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports\">transports that resist both DPI and active probing</a>, and approximately none of these approaches have been deployed at a large scale yet. So it doesn't make sense to say that Tor is blocked in China, because it mischaracterizes Tor as a static protocol. \"Tor\" when it comes to censorship circumvention is a toolbox of options &mdash; some of them work in China, some don't. The ones that work (i.e. that should resist both DPI and active probing) haven't been rolled out very widely, in large part because we have funders who care about the research side but we have nobody who funds the operations, deployment, or scale-up side.</p>\n<p>The long explanation is that it comes down to three issues:</p>\n<p>First, there are some technical steps we haven't finished deploying in terms of collecting statistics about users of <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/bridges\">bridges</a> + <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports\">pluggable transports</a>. The reason is that the server side of the pluggable transport needs to inform the Tor bridge what country the user was from, so the Tor bridge can include that in its (aggregated, anonymized) <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/196-transport-control-ports.txt\">stats that it publishes to the metrics portal</a>.  We've now built most of the pieces, but most of the deployed bridges aren't running the new code yet. So the older bridges that are reporting their user statistics aren't seeing very many users from China, while the bridges that *aren't* reporting their user statistics, which are the ones that offer the newer pluggable transports, aren't well-represented in the graph. We have some nice volunteers looking into <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10680\">what fraction of deployed obfs3 bridges don't have this new 'extended ORPort' feature</a>. But (and you might notice the trend here) we don't have any funders currently who care about counting bridge users in China.</p>\n<p>Second, we need to get more addresses. One approach is to get them from volunteers who sign up their computer as a bridge. That provides great sustainability in terms of community involvement (we did a similar push for obfs2 bridges back when Iran was messing with SSL, and got enough to make a real difference at the time), but one address per volunteer doesn't scale very well. The intuition is that the primary resource that relays volunteer is bandwidth, whereas the primary resource that bridges volunteer is their address &mdash; and while bandwidth is an ongoing contribution, once your IP address gets blocked then your contribution has ended, at least for the country that blocked it, or until you get another address via DHCP, etc. The more scalable approaches to getting bridge addresses involve coordinating with ISPs and network operators, and/or designs like <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/\">Flashproxy</a> to make it really easy for users to sign up their address. I describe these ideas more in \"approach four\" and \"approach five\" of the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses\">Strategies for getting more bridge addresses</a> blog post. But broad deployment of those approaches is again an operational thing, and we don't have any funded projects currently for doing it.</p>\n<p>Third, we need ways of letting people learn about bridges and use them without getting them noticed. We used to think the arms race here was \"how do you give out addresses such that the good guys can learn a few while the bad guys can't learn all of them\", a la the bridges.torproject.org question. But it's increasingly clear that scanning resistance will be the name of the game in China: your transport has to not only blend in with many other flows (to drive up the number of scans they have to launch), but also when they connect to that endpoint and speak your protocol, your service needs to look unobjectionable there as well.  Some combination of <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/\">ScrambleSuit</a> and <a href=\"https://fteproxy.org/\">FTE</a> are great starts here, but it sure is a good thing that the research world has been working on so many prototype designs lately.</p>\n<p>So where does that leave us? It would be neat to think about a broad deployment and operations plan here. I would want to do it in conjunction with some other groups, like Team Cymru on the technical platform side and some on-the-ground partner groups for distributing bridge addresses more effectively among social networks. We've made some good progress on the underlying technologies that would increase the success chances of such a deployment &mdash; though we've mostly been doing it using volunteers in our spare time on the side, so it's slower going than it could be. And several other groups (e.g. <a href=\"https://blog.torservers.net/20131213/torservers-awarded-250000-by-digital-defenders.html\">torservers.net</a>) have recently gotten funding for deploying Tor bridges, so maybe we could combine well with them.</p>\n<p>In any case it won't be a quick and simple job, since all these pieces have to come together. It's increasingly clear that just getting addresses should be the easy part of this. It's how you give them out, and what you run on the server side to defeat China's scanning, that still look like the two tough challenges for somebody trying to scale up their circumvention tool design.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the eleventh issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Accessing the Tor network from China</h1>\n<p>In a new blog post <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-to-read-our-china-usage-graphs\">How to read our China usage graphs</a>, Roger Dingledine looks at the current situation of how Tor is able to circumvent censorship on Chinese Internet accesses. Indeed, if one only looks at the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=userstats-bridge-country&amp;start=2011-10-18&amp;end=2014-01-16&amp;country=cn#userstats-bridge-country\">current bridge users graph</a>, one might believe that Tor is not a solution for users in China.</p>\n<p>“The correct interpretation of the graph is ‘obfs3 bridges have not been deployed enough to keep up with the demand in China’. So it isn’t that Tor is blocked — it’s that we haven’t done much of a deployment for obfs3 bridges or ScrambleSuit bridges, which are the latest steps in the arms race” writes Roger.</p>\n<p>The upcoming version — <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-March/000364.html\">currently in QA phase</a> — of the Tor Browser will include support for the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html\">pluggable transports</a> <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt\">obfs3</a>, <a href=\"https://fteproxy.org/\">FTE</a> and <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/\">Flashproxy</a>. Having these transports ready to be used in a couple of clicks should help Chinese users.</p>\n<p>The “obfs3” protocol is still vulnerable to active probing attacks.  The deployment of its replacement, <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/\">ScrambleSuit</a>, is on-going.  As Roger highlighted, “we need to get more addresses”. <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/strategies-getting-more-bridge-addresses\">Several ways have been thoughts in the past</a>, but until there is more cooperation from ISP and network operators, your can make a difference by <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003886.html\">running a bridge</a> if you can!</p>\n<p>On another front, work is currently on-going on the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git\">bridge distributor</a> to improve how censored users can get a hand on bridge addresses. Yawning Angel also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006476.html\">just released</a> the first version of <a href=\"https://github.com/Yawning/obfsclient\">obfsclient</a> which should help making ScrambleSuit available on Android devices. All in all, the Tor community can hope to welcome back more users from China in a near future.</p>\n<h1>Circumventing censorship through “too-big-too-block” websites</h1>\n<p>Late January, David Fifield <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-January/006159.html\">introduced</a> a new pluggable transport called <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a>. It can be described as “a transport that uses HTTP for carrying bytes and TLS for obfuscation. Traffic is relayed through a third-party server (Google App Engine). It uses a trick to talk to the third party so that it looks like it is talking to an unblocked server.” The approach is close to the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/GoAgent\">GoAgent</a> proxy that has a certain popularity in China.</p>\n<p>With the current version, using Google App Engine, the transport requires no additional configuration. But David also mentioned that <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10984\">a PHP script</a> could also be a good candidate to relay the traffic.  Combined to <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/\">ScrambleSuit</a>, it could allow “a real web site with real pages and everything” to be used as a bridge if a user can provide the shared secret.</p>\n<p>David has made available <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-February/000340.html\">experimental versions</a> of the Tor Browser for anyone to try. The <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/meek.git\">source code</a> has recently <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006506.html\">moved</a> to the Tor Project’s infrastructure, and is ready for more eyes and fingers to play with it.</p>\n<h1>Switching to a single guard node?</h1>\n<p>Last October, Roger Dingledine called for research on <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters\">improving Tor’s anonymity by changing guard parameters </a>. One of these parameters is the number of guard nodes used simultaneously by a Tor client.</p>\n<p>Following up on the <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/~arma/cogs-wpes.pdf\">paper written by Tariq Elahi et al.</a>, Roger’s blog post, and recent discussions during the winter dev. meeting, George Kadianakis made a detailed <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006458.html\">analysis of the implications of switching to a single guard node </a>. He studied the performance implications of switching to a single guard, the performance implications of raising the minimum guard bandwidth for both clients and the overall network, and how the change would affect the overall anonymity and fingerprintability of Tor users.</p>\n<p>Jumping to conclusions: “It seems that the performance implications of switching to 1 guard are not terrible. […] A guard bandwidth threshold of 2MB/s […] seems like it would considerably improve client performance without screwing terribly with the security or the total performance of the network. The fingerprinting problem will be improved in some cases, but still remains unsolved for many of the users […] A proper solution might involve <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9273#comment:4\">guard node buckets</a>”.</p>\n<p>For a better understanding, be sure to look at George’s work which includes graphs and proper explanations.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>George Kadianakis <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-March/004074.html\">announced</a> obfsproxy version 0.2.7.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the twelfth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor 0.2.5.3-alpha is out</h1>\n<p>Nick Mathewson cut <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032448.html\">a new release</a> of the Tor development branch on March 23rd: “Tor 0.2.5.3-alpha includes all the fixes from 0.2.4.21. It contains two new anti-DoS features for Tor relays, resolves a bug that kept SOCKS5 support for IPv6 from working, fixes several annoying usability issues for bridge users, and removes more old code for unused directory formats.”</p>\n<p>This release also marks the first step toward the stabilization of Tor 0.2.5, as from now on “no feature patches not already written will be considered for inclusion”.</p>\n<p>The source is available at <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">the usual location</a>, as are updated binary packages.</p>\n<h1>Tails 0.23 is out…</h1>\n<p>…but many Tails users are already running it. Now that incremental upgrades have been turned on by default with the previous release, users of Tails on USB sticks have been able to enjoy the process of a smooth upgrade in three clicks.</p>\n<p>As always, <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_0.23/\">the new release</a> fixes several <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_0.22.1/\">security holes</a>. That alone should make anyone switch, but the new version finally brings with it two long-awaited features and many small improvements.</p>\n<p>Tails will now do “MAC spoofing” by default. To hide the hardware address used on the local network, Tails will now use a randomized address by default. This will help prevent the tracking of one’s geographical location across networks. For more information about MAC spoofing, why it matters, and when it might be relevant to turn it off, be sure to read the very well-written <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/mac_spoofing/\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<p>Another important feature is the integrated support for proxies and Tor bridges. This should be of immense help to users of Tails on censored networks. The integration is done using the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-launcher.git\">Tor Launcher extension</a>, familiar to everyone who has used recent versions of the Tor Browser.</p>\n<p>For examples of smaller features and bugfixes: Tor, obfsproxy, I2P, Pidgin and the web browser have been upgraded, a 64-bit kernel is used on most systems to pave the way for UEFI support, documentation is now accessible from the greeter, and the “New identity” option in the browser is available again.</p>\n<p>The next Tails release is scheduled for April 29th and will be 1.0.  For this important milestone in 5 years of intense work, the Tails team is still looking for a <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/logo_contest/\">logo</a>.</p>\n<h1>New Tor Browser releases</h1>\n<p>The Tor Browser team put out two new releases based on <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.4\">Firefox 24.4.0esr</a>. <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-353-released\">Version 3.5.3</a> is meant as a safe upgrade for every Tor Browser user. Among other changes, the new version contains an updated Tor, a fix for a potential freeze, a fix for the Ubuntu keyboard issue and a way to prevent disk leaks when watching videos.</p>\n<p>On top of the preceding changes, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-36-beta-1-released\">version 3.6-beta-1</a> is the culmination of a months-long effort to seamlessly integrate <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html\">pluggable transports</a> into the Tor Browser. In the network settings, users can now choose “Connect with provided bridges” and select from <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt\">“obfs3”</a>, <a href=\"https://fteproxy.org/\">“fte”</a> or <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/\">“flashproxy”</a>. Entering custom bridges is also supported and will work for direct, obfs2 and obfs3 bridges.</p>\n<p>Other usability changes include wording improvements in the connection wizard, translatable Tor status messages, and the use of disk image (DMG) instead of ZIP archives for Mac OS X. </p>\n<p>Please upgrade, in any case, and consider helping iron out the remaining issues in the 3.6 branch.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Since the 3.5 release, “Tor Browser Bundle is more like a standalone browser and less like a bundle”. This led the Tor Browser team to plan to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11193\">“rename it to just ‘Tor Browser’ everywhere”</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000491.html\">Berkay</a> and to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000492.html\">André Schulz</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project website!</p>\n<p>Alex <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032441.html\">reported</a> an “important case about Tor relay operators” which came to court in Athens, Greece on March 18th. The defendant, a Tor relay operator, was acquitted after proving that the IP address used for criminal activity was in fact a Tor relay.</p>\n<p>Connections to Twitter from inside Turkey were <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/03/after-dns-change-fails-turkish-government-steps-up-twitter-censorship/\">blocked by the Turkish government</a> on 20th March, leading to <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=userstats-relay-country&amp;start=2014-01-01&amp;end=2014-03-26&amp;country=tr&amp;events=off#userstats-relay-country\">an increase</a> in the number of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-26714214\">Tor users there</a>.</p>\n<p>Jacob Appelbaum presented a keynote titled “Free software for freedom, surveillance and you” at <a href=\"http://libreplanet.org/2014/program/sessions.html\">LibrePlanet 2014</a>. The presentation was done remotely from Berlin using Tor and <a href=\"https://github.com/ioerror/freenote\">GStreamer</a>.</p>\n<p>James Valleroy wrote to tor-relays <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-March/004108.html\"></a> asking the best way to configure the FreedomBox <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox\"></a> as a Tor bridge. Lance Hathaway explained <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-March/004111.html\"></a> about pluggable transports and Roger Dingledine mentioned <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-March/004134.html\"></a> the potential issues of relaying a bridge and a hidden service at the same time.</p>\n<p>Aymeric Vitte <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032432.html\">wrote</a> to tor-talk to mention an implementation of the Tor protocol in JavaScript. Sadly, the project is not free software yet.</p>\n<p>A Tor exit operator recently <a href=\"https://pay.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/20243q/iaman_operator_of_eight_tor_relays_including_two\">held an Ask Me Anything</a> on Reddit, which was quite successful, generating over 800 upvotes, 478 comments, and being read by thousands. The most popular questions were focused on how to improve the use of Tor, the legality of exit nodes, discussions on hidden services, the workings of Tor, and many other topics related to privacy and security.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Users sometimes want to know how to transfer their bookmarks from an old Tor Browser to an updated one. Mozilla provide instructions on how to do this on their <a href=\"http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>The new Tor Browser releases were again prevented from working properly by WebRoot Internet Security. The error message is “Couldn’t load XPCOM”. Users need to disable WebRoot, whitelist the appropriate Tor Browser files, and more importantly contact WebRoot support to warn them that their product is breaking the Tor Browser and, to the best of Tor support’s knowledge, Firefox stable releases. Ideally, WebRoot should test new releases before harming Tor users. See <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11268\">#11268</a> if you want to help.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>uighur1984 wanted to <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1783/88\">set up a hidden service for their public-facing website</a> and decided that the HiddenServiceDir should be the same like the DocumentRoot of the website. This led to some problems with access rights. Sam Whited clarified that both directories should be separated: the data in the HiddenServiceDir doesn't contain any actual data from the website, but only the keys and other information from the hidden service.</p>\n<p>Gondalse shot a video showing policemen torturing a citizen. The release of the video led to a trial, and Gondalse <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1790/88\">fears that someone might try to track the owner of the video down</a>. Jens Kubieziel pointed out some OPSEC rules, and showed which problems can lead to deanonymization.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, Matt Pagan, harmony, qbi, Jesse Victors, and Karsten Loesing.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

After you have downloaded the bundle and before you install/extract it, you should also verify it to make sure the bundle you downloaded is genuine and has not been tampered with; this step is optional but recommended.</p>\n<p>We have screencasts (video guides) that will help you with the installation and verification process on Windows, Linux and OS X.</p>\n<p><strong>Windows</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/video/TBBTraining/TBBTraining-DownloadAndVerify-Windows.mp4\">TBBTraining-DownloadAndVerify-Windows.mp4</a></p>\n<p>Mirror:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/mirrors/media.torproject.org/video/TBBTraining/TBBTraining-DownloadAndVerify-Windows.mp4\">torservers.net</a></p>\n<p><strong>Linux</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/video/TBBTraining/TBBTraining-DownloadAndVerify-Linux.mp4\">TBBTraining-DownloadAndVerify-Linux.mp4</a></p>\n<p>Mirror:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/mirrors/media.torproject.org/video/TBBTraining/TBBTraining-DownloadAndVerify-Linux.mp4\">torservers.net</a></p>\n<p><strong>OS X</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/video/TBBTraining/TBBTraining-DownloadAndVerify-MacOS.mp4\">TBBTraining-DownloadAndVerify-MacOS.mp4</a></p>\n<p>Mirror:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/mirrors/media.torproject.org/video/TBBTraining/TBBTraining-DownloadAndVerify-MacOS.mp4\">torservers.net</a></p>\n<p><strong>Text guide for signature verification</strong><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en\">https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en</a></p>\n<p>Mirrors:<br />\n<a href=\"https://s.eff.org/tor-mirror/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en\">EFF</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/mirrors/torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en\">torservers.net</a></p>\n<h2><a id=\"1\">Tor Browser Bundle Downloads</a></h2>\n<h3>torproject.org</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en\">https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en</a></p>\n<p>Mirrors:<br />\n<a href=\"https://s.eff.org/tor-mirror/projects/torbrowser.html.en\">EFF</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/mirrors/torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en\">torservers.net</a></p>\n<h3>GetTor</h3>\n<p>GetTor is a program for serving the Tor Browser Bundle through email. This is particulary useful if you cannot access torproject.org or any other mirrors. </p>\n<p>To request a bundle from GetTor, send a blank email to <a href=\"mailto:gettor@torproject.org\">gettor@torproject.org</a>.

This is no longer the case and you can request for bundles from <strong>any</strong> email address, including Outlook.</p>\n<h1>Bridges</h1>\n<p>If you are unable to reach the Tor network after installation (Tor Launcher starts, however the green progress bar stops), you need to use bridges.</p>\n<h3>Acquiring Bridges</h3>\n<p>One way to find public bridge addresses is to send an email (from a Gmail or a Yahoo! address) to <a href=\"mailto:bridges@bridges.torproject.org\">bridges@bridges.torproject.org</a> with the line 'get bridges' by itself in the body of the mail.</p>\n<p>You can also acquire bridges by visiting <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/\" title=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/\">https://bridges.torproject.org/</a>. If you see that this page is offline, please wait for a few minutes and try again.</p>\n<h3>Bridge Usage</h3>\n<p>1. Launch the Tor Browser Bundle<br />\n2. Click \"Configure\"<br />\n3. Click \"Next\" until you reach a page that reads \"If this computer's Internet connection is censored, you will need to obtain and use bridge relays\"<br />\n4. Enter the bridges you received from one of the methods above into the text box<br />\n5. Click \"Connect\"</p>\n<h1>Pluggable Transports</h1>\n<p>If you find that using standard bridges fails for you, you can try using the 3.6-beta-1 bundle located on the same downloads page listed above. These bundles included integrated pluggable transport support, and are useful in areas where standard bridges are blocked.</p>\n<p>To activate pluggable transports in the 3.6-beta-1 bundle, follow the bridge directions above, however simply select \"obfs3\" or \"fte\" when you reach the bridge configuration page (instead of entering bridge addresses yourself).</p>\n<h1>Support</h1>\n<p>Still need help?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the thirteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor Project website redesign takes two steps forward</h1>\n<p>Andrew Lewman put out two calls for help with the ongoing Tor Project<br />\nwebsite redesign: <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/www-team/2014-March/000238.html\">one for the sponsor page</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/www-team/2014-March/000249.html\">another for the download area</a>. Both were immediately met with proposals and design suggestions from the www-team mailing list: Olssy produced <a href=\"http://tor.harrytuttle.net/\">two mock-ups</a> of the sponsorship page as possible models for further work, while William Papper and Lance Tuller have been <a href=\"https://github.com/wpapper/tor-download-web\">working on a repository</a> for the download page, with comments from other list members on topics such as the use of Javascript and possible layout decisions.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to give the website redesign further momentum, please see the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/Website\">dedicated project page on the wiki</a> for open tickets and advice on how to contribute, then come to the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/www-team\">www-team mailing list</a> and join in!</p>\n<h1>QR codes for bridge addresses</h1>\n<p>Since most pocket computers (sometimes called “phones”) and laptops began incorporating cameras, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code\">QR codes</a> have become a ubiquitous way to enter short sequences of data into our devices. URLs are the canonical example, but the process also works for Bitcoin addresses or <a href=\"http://web.monkeysphere.info/monkeysign/\">OpenPGP fingerprints</a>.</p>\n<p>Bridges are the standard tool for circumventing filters that prevent access to the Tor network. Users currently enter bridge addresses in Tor by copy/pasting from the <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/\">BridgeDB web page</a> or auto-responder email. But manually giving IP addresses and fingerprints to Orbot on keyboard-less devices is an error-prone process.</p>\n<p>QR codes might be a solution to this problem. They could also enable peer-to-peer exchange among friends, or circumvention strategies involving IPv6 addresses and paper. According to Isis Lovecruft, <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11345\">adding QR codes to the BridgeDB web interface</a> would be easy. Would any reader feel like <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/5096\">hacking Orbot</a> or the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-launcher.git\">Tor Launcher</a> Firefox extension (see relevant <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebRTC/taking_webcam_photos\">documentation</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator.getUserMedia\">API</a>)?</p>\n<h1>Client identification in hidden service applications</h1>\n<p>Applications behind hidden services currently cannot easily differentiate between client connections. Tor will make a different local TCP connection for each connections it receives, but the software is unable to tell if they are coming from the same circuit. Harry SeventyOne <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006576.html\">felt</a> the latter would be useful to enable applications for diagnostic log analysis, identifying traffic trends, rate-limiting or temporarily blocking operations coming from the same client.</p>\n<p>Harry sent a very rough patch to the Tor development mailing which enables circuit distinction by using a different source IP address from the IPv4 localhost pool (<code>127.0.0.0/8</code>) for each circuit. Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006610.html\">liked the idea</a> and gave several comments about the preliminary patch. Hopefully this work will make the life of hidden service operators easier in the future.</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for March 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of March has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000487.html\">Georg Koppen</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000488.html\">Pearl Crescent</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-March/000489.html\">Damian Johnson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000490.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000491.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000492.html\">Matt Pagan</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000494.html\">Lunar</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000495.html\">Karsten Loesing</a>.</p>\n<p>Lunar also reported <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000493.html\">help desk statistics</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>An extensive guide to <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBrowser/Hacking\">hacking on Tor Browser</a> was posted to the Tor Project’s wiki by Mike Perry. Among other things, it covers the browser’s build instructions, design principles and testing procedures, as well as a summary of how browser team members organize and communicate. If you’d like to get involved in Tor Browser development, please take a look!</p>\n<p>Nicholas Hopper <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006563.html\">followed</a> <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006575.html\">up</a> on George Kadianakis’ research on switching to a single guard. He used Aaron Johnson’s TorPS simulator to find out the “typical” bandwidth for a client. The conclusions match George’s: a single guard and a bandwidth cutoff of 2 Mbit/s would improve over the current situation. George subsequently sent an <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006570.html\">initial draft proposal</a> to start the formal process.</p>\n<p>BridgeDB version 1.6 was <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git/commit/f266f32\">deployed on March 26th</a>. Thanks to Isis Lovecruft, users should now be able to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10809\">solve the CAPTCHA again</a>. A custom solution is now used instead of Google’s reCAPTCHA services which will give more flexibility in the future.</p>\n<p>John Brooks <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032476.html\">presented</a> Torsion, “a ready-to-use hidden service instant messaging client”. “I’m looking for people to try it out, validate my ideas and implementation, and help plan the future”, wrote John. You can consult the design documentation and build instructions on <a href=\"https://github.com/special/torsion\">Github</a>; please share your comments with the community!</p>\n<p>Martin Weinelt <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-March/004168.html\">shared</a> a <a href=\"https://github.com/mweinelt/munin-tor\">plugin</a> that generates graphs in the <a href=\"http://munin-monitoring.org/\">Munin network monitoring tool</a> from data provided by Tor, using <a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/\">Stem</a>. “At the moment it supports a connection graph, getting its data from orconn-status. More graphs are possible, but not yet implemented. Ideas are welcome,” wrote Martin.</p>\n<p>Amid the ongoing censorship of internet services in Turkey, there were <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032487.html\">reports</a> that the Tor Project’s website was unavailable over connections supplied by some Turkish ISPs. Feel free to try one of the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/mirrors.html\">mirrors</a>!</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006602.html\">published</a> a draft of <a href=\"http://csxeeumg5ynu2rk7.onion/\">a guide</a> to running a blog over a Tor hidden service using the <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll static site generator</a>. “The intended audience are bloggers who can handle a terminal window but who don’t know the typical pitfalls of securely setting up a web server over a hidden service”, he wrote. However, the guide is in its first stages, and “may contain severe problems harming your privacy!” Feedback on its content, wording, and layout would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>Yawning Angel <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006592.html\">called</a> for help with testing <a href=\"https://github.com/Yawning/obfsclient/archive/v0.0.2.tar.gz\">obfsclient 0.0.2</a>, a C++ implementation of the obfs3 and ScrambleSuit pluggable transports: “This is mostly a bug fix release that addresses issues found in testing/actual use […] Questions, comments, feedback appreciated as always.”</p>\n<p>Michael Rogers has been “working on a messaging app that uses Tor hidden services to provide unlinkability (from the point of view of a network observer) between users and their contacts”. But as “users know who their contacts are”, the mutual anonymity provided by hidden services is not a requirement. Michael <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006572.html\">asked</a> how hidden services performance could be improved for this use case.</p>\n<p>On the Tor Blog, Sukhbir Singh <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ways-get-tor-browser-bundle\">posted</a> a round-up of the various methods by which users can download and run the Tor Browser, covering download mirrors, GetTor, bridge address distribution, and pluggable transports usage. If you’re having trouble acquiring or using a copy of the Tor Browser, please look here for links and guidance.</p>\n<p>Mike Perry <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032503.html\">discovered</a> “that the Linux kernel appears to have a leak in how it applies transproxy rules to the TCP CLOSE_WAIT shutdown condition under certain circumstances”. Be sure to look at Mike’s email if you use Tor’s TransProxy feature. velope later <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032507.html\">improved</a> the original mitigating firewall rule.</p>\n<p>As part of the ongoing project to rewrite the Tor Weather service, Sreenatha Bhatlapenumarthi and Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9889\">collaborated</a> to produce a Python script that enables it to determine whether or not relay operators have fulfilled the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/tshirt\">requirements</a> for a free Tor T-shirt.</p>\n<p>Lukas Erlacher announced the avaibility of <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-March/006603.html\">OnionPy</a>, “a Python wrapper for OnionOO with support for transparently caching OnionOO replies in memcached”. It should be useful to the on-going rewrite of the <a href=\"https://weather.torproject.org/\">Tor Weather service</a>.</p>\n<p>The deadline for submissions to the Tails logo contest passed on March 31st; you can review all of the proposed designs, from the minimalist to the psychedelic, <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/logo/\">on the Tails website</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>The help desk often gets confusing reports that after being directed to download the latest Tor Browser version by a flashing TorBrowserButton, users still sometimes see a message that their Tor Browser is out of date. This happens when the new Tor Browser version was installed over the previous one. Fortunately the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11242\">underlying bug</a> will be fixed in the next Tor Browser release. We recommend extracting each Tor Browser update to an empty directory rather than overwriting the old one, to prevent similar unexpected behaviors. The longer-term solution for issues like this is an <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/4234\">auto-updating</a> Tor Browser.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>saurav wanted to know the total bandwidth of all guard nodes in the <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1824/88\">current network</a>. gacar pointed to the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/stats/bandwidth.csv\">bandwidth.csv file</a> and explained the format of the file.</p>\n<p>Tor’s StackExchange site is doing a <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/review/site-eval\">self-evaluation</a>. If you have an account, please log in and evaluate the questions as well as their answers. It helps to improve the answers and the site in general.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if you happen to visit the site, check the list of <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/unanswered\">unanswered questions</a>. If you know an answer, please share your knowledge with the people.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, harmony, David Fifield, Matt Pagan, qbi and Karsten Loesing.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN? Please help us create this newsletter. We still need more volunteers to watch the Tor community and report<br />\nimportant news. Please see the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorWeeklyNews\">project page</a>, write down your name and subscribe to the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/news-team\">team mailing list</a> if you want to get involved!</p>"

    "content": "<p><b>Updates:</b> See the <a href=\"#Changes\">Changes</a> section for a list of changes since initial posting.</p>\n<h1>Executive Summary</h1>\n<p>The future is here, and ahead of schedule. Come join us, the weather's nice.</p>\n<p>This blog post describes the installation and configuration of a prototype of a secure, full-featured, Android telecommunications device with full Tor support, individual application firewalling, true cell network baseband isolation, and optional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRTP\">ZRTP</a> encrypted voice and video support. ZRTP does run over UDP which is not yet possible to send over Tor, but we are able to send SIP account login and call setup over Tor independently.</p>\n<p>The SIP client we recommend also supports dialing normal telephone numbers if you have a SIP gateway that provides trunking service.</p>\n<p>Aside from a handful of binary blobs to manage the device firmware and graphics  acceleration, the entire system can be assembled (and recompiled) using only FOSS components. However, as an added bonus, we will describe how to handle the Google Play store as well, to mitigate <a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/02/04/android-market-web-store-backdoor-phone-hackers/\">the</a> <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/19/android-upgrades-open-a-backdoor-to-malware-researchers-show/\">two</a> infamous Google Play Backdoors.</p>\n<p><a name=\"Introduction\"><br />\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p></a></p>\n<p>Android is the most popular mobile platform in the world, with a wide variety of applications, including many applications that aid in communications security, censorship circumvention, and activist organization. Moreover, the core of the Android platform is Open Source, auditable, and modifiable by anyone.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately though, mobile devices in general and Android devices in particular have not been designed with privacy in mind. In fact, they've seemingly been designed with nearly the opposite goal: to make it easy for third parties, telecommunications companies, sophisticated state-sized adversaries, and even random hackers to extract all manner of personal information from the user. This includes the full content of personal communications with business partners and loved ones. Worse still, by default, the user is given very little in the way of control or even informed consent about what information is being collected and how.</p>\n<p>This post aims to address this, but we must first admit we stand on the shoulders of giants. Organizations like <a href=\"http://www.cyanogenmod.org/\">Cyanogen</a>, <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/\">F-Droid</a>, the <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/\">Guardian Project</a>, and many others have done a great deal of work to try to improve this situation by restoring control of Android devices to the user, and to ensure the integrity of our personal communications. However, all of these projects have shortcomings and often leave gaps in what they provide and protect. Even in cases where proper security and privacy features exist, they typically require extensive configuration to use safely, securely, and correctly.</p>\n<p>This blog post enumerates and documents these gaps, describes workarounds for serious shortcomings, and provides suggestions for future work.</p>\n<p>It is also meant to serve as a HOWTO to walk interested, technically capable people through the end-to-end installation and configuration of a prototype of a secure and private Android device, where access to the network is restricted to an approved list of applications, and all traffic is routed through the Tor network. </p>\n<p>It is our hope that this work can be replicated and eventually fully automated, given a good UI, and rolled into a single ROM or ROM addon package for ease of use. Ultimately, there is no reason why this system could not become a full fledged off the shelf product, given proper hardware support and good UI for the more technical bits.</p>\n<p>The remainder of this document is divided into the following sections:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#Hardware\">Hardware Selection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Installation\">Installation and Setup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#GoogleApps\">Google Apps Setup</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Software\">Recommended Software</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Backup\">Device Backup Procedure</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#MicrophoneRemoval\">Removing the Built-in Microphone</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#BasebandRemoval\">Removing Baseband Remnants</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#FutureWork\">Future Work</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#Changes\">Changes Since Initial Posting</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p><a name=\"Hardware\"><br />\n<h1>Hardware Selection</h1>\n<p></a></p>\n<p>If you truly wish to secure your mobile device from remote compromise, it is necessary to carefully select your hardware. First and foremost, it is <a href=\"http://www.osnews.com/story/27416/The_second_operating_system_hiding_in_every_mobile_phone\">absolutely essential</a> that the carrier's baseband firmware is completely isolated from the rest of the platform. Because your cell phone baseband does not authenticate the network (in part to allow roaming), any random hacker with <a href=\"http://www.openbts.org/\">their own cell network</a> can exploit these backdoors and use them to install malware on your device.</p>\n<p>While there are projects underway to determine which handsets actually provide true hardware baseband isolation, at the time of this writing there is very little public information available on this topic. Hence, the only safe option remains a device with no cell network support at all (though cell network connectivity can still be provided by a separate device). For the purposes of this post, the reference device is the WiFi-only version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_7_%282013_version%29\">2013 Google Nexus 7 tablet</a>.</p>\n<p>For users who wish to retain full mobile access, we recommend obtaining a cell modem device that provides a WiFi access point for data services only. These devices do not have microphones and in some cases do not even have fine-grained GPS units (because they are not able to make emergency calls). They are also available with prepaid plans, for rates around $20-30 USD per month, for about 2GB/month of 4G data. If coverage and reliability is important to you though, you may want to go with a slightly more expensive carrier. In the US, T-Mobile isn't bad, but Verizon is superb.</p>\n<p>To increase battery life of your cell connection, you can connect this access point to an external mobile USB battery pack, which typically will provide 36-48 hours of continuous use with a 6000mAh battery.</p>\n<p>The total cost of a Wifi-only tablet with cell modem and battery pack is only roughly USD $50 more than the 4G LTE version of the same device.</p>\n<p>In this way, you achieve true baseband isolation, with no risk of <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/2100-1029-6140191.html\">audio</a> or <a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/new-hi-tech-police-surveillance-the-stingray-cell-phone-spying-device/5331165\">network</a> surveillance, <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot12/woot12-final24.pdf\">baseband exploits</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/replicant-developers-find-and-close-samsung-galaxy-backdoor\">provider backdoors</a>. Effectively, this cell modem is just another untrusted router in a long, long chain of untrustworthy Internet infrastructure.</p>\n<p>However, do note though that even if the cell unit does not contain a fine-grained GPS, you still sacrifice location privacy while using it. Over an extended period of time, it will be possible to make inferences about your physical activity, behavior and personal preferences, and your identity, based on cell tower use alone.</p>\n<p><a name=\"Installation\"><br />\n<h1>Installation and Setup</h1>\n<p></a></p>\n<p>We will focus on the installation of Cyanogenmod 11 using Team Win Recovery Project, both to give this HOWTO some shelf life, and because Cyanogenmod 11 features full SELinux support (Dear NSA: What happened to you guys? You used to be cool. Well, some of you. Some of the time. Maybe. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/31/us-usa-security-nsa-rsa-idUSBREA2U0TY20140331\">Or maybe not</a>).</p>\n<p>The use of Google Apps and Google Play services is not recommended due to security issues with Google Play. However, we do provide workarounds for mitigating those issues, if Google Play is required for your use case.</p>\n<h2>Installation and Setup: ROM and Core App Installation</h2>\n<p>With the 2013 Google Nexus 7 tablet, installation is fairly straight-forward. In fact, it is actually possible to install and use the device before associating it with a Google Account in any way. This is a desirable property, because by default, the otherwise mandatory initial setup process of the stock Google ROM sends your device MAC address directly to Google and links it to your Google account (all without using Tor, of course).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_flo\">official Cyanogenmod installation instructions</a> are available online, but with a fresh out of the box device, here are the key steps for installation without activating the default ROM code at all (using Team Win Recovery Project instead of ClockWorkMod).</p>\n<p>First, on your desktop/laptop computer (preferably Linux), perform the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=flo\">Download</a> the latest CyanogenMod 11 release (we used cm-11-20140504-SNAPSHOT-M6)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://teamw.in/project/twrp2/193\">Download</a> the latest Team Win Recovery Project image (we used 2.7.0.0)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk\">Download</a> the F-Droid package (we used 0.66)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=orbot&amp;fdid=org.torproject.android\">Download</a> the Orbot package from F-Droid (we used 13.0.7)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=droidwall&amp;fdid=com.googlecode.droidwall\">Download</a> the Droidwall package from F-Droid (we used 1.5.7)</li>\n<li><a a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/android-firewall.zip\">Download</a> the Droidwall Firewall Scripts attached to this blogpost</li>\n<li><a a href=\"http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Google_Apps\">Download</a> the Google Apps for Cyanogenmod 11 (optional)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br>Because the download integrity for all of these packages is abysmal, here is a <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/sha256sums-cm11.txt.asc\">signed set of SHA256 hashes</a> I've observed for those packages.</p>\n<p>Once you have all of those packages, boot your tablet into fastboot mode by holding the Power button and the Volume Down button during a cold boot. Then, attach it to your desktop/laptop machine with a USB cable and run the following commands from a Linux/UNIX shell:</p>\n<pre>\n apt-get install android-tools-adb android-tools-fastboot\n fastboot devices\n fastboot oem unlock\n fastboot flash recovery openrecovery-twrp-2.7.0.0-flo.img\n</pre><p>\n<br>After the recovery firmware is flashed successfully, use the volume keys to select <i>Recovery</i> and hit the power button to reboot the device (or power it off, and then boot holding Power and Volume Up).</p>\n<p>Once Team Win boots, go into <i>Wipe</i> and select <i>Advanced Wipe</i>. Select all checkboxes except for USB-OTG, and slide to wipe. Once the wipe is done, click <i>Format Data</i>. After the format completes, issue these commands from your Linux shell:</p>\n<pre>\n adb server start\n adb push cm-11-20140504-SNAPSHOT-M6-flo.zip /sdcard/\n adb push gapps-kk-20140105-signed.zip /sdcard/ # Optional\n</pre><p>\n<br>After this push process completes, go to the <i>Install</i> menu, and select the Cyanogen zip, and optionally the gapps zip for installation. Then click Reboot, and select System.</p>\n<p>After rebooting into your new installation, skip all CyanogenMod and Google setup, disable location reporting, and immediately disable WiFi and turn on Airplane mode. </p>\n<p>Then, go into <i>Settings -> About Tablet</i> and scroll to the bottom and click the greyed out Build number 5 times until developer mode is enabled. Then go into <i>Settings -> Developer Options</i> and turn on <i>USB Debugging</i>. </p>\n<p>After that, run the following commands from your Linux shell:</p>\n<pre>\n adb install FDroid.apk\n adb install org.torproject.android_86.apk\n adb install com.googlecode.droidwall_157.apk\n</pre><p>\n<br>You will need to approve the ADB connection for the first package, and then they should install normally.</p>\n<p><b>VERY IMPORTANT:</b> Whenever you finish using adb, <b>always remember</b> to disable <i>USB Debugging</i> and restore <i>Root Access</i> to <i>Apps only</i>. While Android 4.2+ ROMs now prompt you to authorize an RSA key fingerprint before allowing a debugging connection (thus mitigating adb exploit tools that bypass screen lock and can install root apps), you still risk additional vulnerability surface by leaving debugging enabled.</p>\n<h2>Installation and Setup: Initial Configuration</h2>\n<p>After the base packages are installed, go into the Settings app, and make the following changes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Wireless &amp; Networks More... =></li>\n<ul>\n<li>Temporarily Disable Airplane Mode</li>\n<li>NFC -> Disable</li>\n<li>Re-enable Airplane Mode</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Location Access -> Off</li>\n<li>Security =></li>\n<ul>\n<li>PIN screen Lock</li>\n<li>Allow Unknown Sources (For F-Droid)</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Language &amp; Input =></li>\n<ul>\n<li>Spell Checker -> Android Spell Checker -> Disable Contact Names</li>\n<li>Disable Google Voice Typing/Hotword detection</li>\n<li>Android Keyboard (AOSP) =>\n<ul>\n<li>Disable AOSP next-word suggestion (do this first!)</li>\n<li>Auto-correction -> Off</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n<li>Backup &amp; reset =></li>\n<ul>\n<li>Enable <i>Back up my data</i> (just temporarily, for the next step)</li>\n<li>Uncheck <i>Automatic restore</i></li>\n<li>Disable <i>Backup my data</i></li>\n</ul>\n<li>About Tablet -> Cyanogenmod Statistics -> Disable reporting</li>\n<li>Developer Options -> Device Hostname -> localhost</li>\n<li>SuperUser -> Settings (three dots) -> Notifications -> Notification (not toast)</li>\n<li>Privacy -> Privacy Guard =>\n<ul>\n<li>Enabled by default</li>\n<li>Settings (three dots) -> Show Built In Apps</li>\n<li>Enable Privacy Guard for every app with the following exceptions:\n<ul>\n<li>Calendar</li>\n<li>Config Updater</li>\n<li>Google Account Manager (long press)</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Modify Settings -> Off</li>\n<li>Wifi Change -> Off</li>\n<li>Data Change -> Off</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Google Play Services (long press)</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Location -> Off</li>\n<li>Modify Settings -> Off</li>\n<li>Draw on top -> Off</li>\n<li>Record Audio -> Off</li>\n<li>Wifi Change -> Off</li>\n</ul>\n<li> Google Play Store (long press)</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Location -> Off</li>\n<li>Send SMS -> Off</li>\n<li>Modify Settings -> Off</li>\n<li>Data change -> Off</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Google Services Framework (long press)</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Modify Settings -> Off</li>\n<li>Wifi Change -> Off</li>\n<li>Data Change -> Off</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Trebuchet</li>\n</ul>\n</ul>\n</ol>\n<p><br>Now, it is time to encrypt your tablet. It is important to do this step early, as I have noticed additional apps and configuration tweaks can make this process fail later on.</p>\n<p>We will also do this from the shell, in order to set a different password than your screen unlock pin. This is done to mitigate the risk of compromise of this password from shoulder surfers, and to allow the use of a much longer (and non-numeric) password that you would prefer not to type every time you unlock the screen.</p>\n<p>To do this, open the Terminal app, and type the following commands:</p>\n<pre>\nsu\nvdc cryptfs enablecrypto inplace NewMoreSecurePassword\n</pre><p>\n<br>Watch for typos! That command does not ask you to re-type that password for confirmation.</p>\n<h2>Installation and Setup: Disabling Invasive Apps and Services</h2>\n<p>Before you configure the Firewall or enable the network, you likely want to disable at least a subset of the following built-in apps and services, by using <i>Settings -> Apps -> All</i>, and then clicking on each app and hitting the <i>Disable</i> button:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>com.android.smspush</li>\n<li>com.google.android.voicesearch</li>\n<li>Face Unlock</li>\n<li>Google Backup Transport</li>\n<li>Google Calendar Sync</li>\n<li>Google One Time Init</li>\n<li>Google Partner Setup</li>\n<li>Google Contacts Sync</li>\n<li>Google Search</li>\n<li>Hangouts</li>\n<li>Market Feedback Agent</li>\n<li>News &amp; Weather</li>\n<li>One Time Init</li>\n<li>Picasa Updater</li>\n<li>Sound Search for Google Play</li>\n<li>TalkBack</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a name=\"Firewall\"><br />\n<h2>Installation and Setup: Tor and Firewall configuration</h2>\n<p></a></p>\n<p>Ok, now let's install the firewall and tor support scripts. Go back into <i>Settings -> Developer Options</i> and enable <i>USB Debugging</i> and change <i>Root Access</i> to <i>Apps and ADB</i>. Then, unzip the <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/android-firewall.zip\">android-firewall.zip</a> on your laptop, and run the <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/android-firewall/install-firewall.sh\">installation script</a>:</p>\n<pre>\n./install-firewall.sh\n</pre><p>\n<br>That firewall installation provides several key scripts that provide functionality that is currently impossible to achieve with any app (including Orbot):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It installs a <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/android-firewall/userinit.sh\">userinit script</a> to block all network access during boot.</li>\n<li>It disables \"Google Captive Portal Detection\", which involves connection attempts to Google servers upon Wifi assocation (these requests are made by the Android <i>Settings</i> UID, which should normally be blocked from the network, unless you are first registering for Google Play).</li>\n<li>It contains a <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/android-firewall/firewall-torify-all.sh\">Droidwall script</a> that configures Tor transproxy rules to send all of your traffic through Tor. These rules include a fix for a Linux kernel <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032503.html\">Tor transproxy packet leak issue</a>.</li>\n<li>The main firewall-torify-all.sh Droidwall script also includes an input firewall, to block all inbound connections to the device. It also fixes a Droidwall <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/droidwall/issues/detail?id=260\">permissions vulnerability</a></li>\n<li>It installs an <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/android-firewall/firewall-allow-nontor-browser.sh\">optional script</a> to allow the Browser app to bypass Tor for logging into WiFi captive portals.</li>\n<li>It installs an <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/android-firewall/firewall-allow-adb.sh\">optional script</a> to temporarily allow network adb access when you need it (if you are paranoid about USB exploits, which you should be).</li>\n<li>It provides an <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/android-firewall/firewall-allow-linphone-udp.sh\">optional script</a> to allow the UDP activity of LinPhone to bypass Tor, to allow ZRTP-encrypted Voice and Video SIP/VoIP calls. SIP account login/registration and call setup/signaling can be done over TCP, and Linphone's TCP activity is still sent through Tor with this script.\n </li>\n</ol>\n<p><br>Note that with the exception of the userinit network blocking script, installing these scripts does not activate them. You still need to configure Droidwall to use them.</p>\n<p>We use Droidwall instead of Orbot or AFWall+ for five reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Droidwall's app-based firewall and Orbot's transproxy are known to conflict and reset one another.</li>\n<li>Droidwall does not randomly drop transproxy rules when switching networks (Orbot has had several of these types of bugs).</li>\n<li>Unlike AFWall+, Droidwall is able to auto-launch at \"boot\" (though still not before the network and Android Services come online and make connections).</li>\n<li>AFWall+'s \"fix\" for this startup data leak problem does not work on Cyanogenmod (hence our userinit script instead).</li>\n<li>Aside from the permissions issue fixed by our firewall-torify-all.sh script, AFWall+ provides no additional security fixes over the stock Droidwall.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br>To make use of the firewall scripts, open up Droidwall and hit the config button (the vertical three dots), go to <i>More -> Set Custom Script</i>. Enter the following:</p>\n<pre>\n. /data/local/firewall-torify-all.sh\n#. /data/local/firewall-allow-adb.sh\n#. /data/local/firewall-allow-linphone-udp.sh\n#. /data/local/firewall-allow-nontor-browser.sh\n</pre><p>\n<br><b>NOTE:</b> You must not make any typos in the above. If you mistype any of those files, things may break. Because the userinit.sh script blocks all network at boot, if you make a typo in the torify script, you will be unable to use the Internet at all!</p>\n<p>Also notice that these scripts have been installed into a readonly root directory. Because they are run as root, installing them to a world-writable location like /sdcard/ is extremely unwise.</p>\n<p>Later, if you want to enable one of network adb, LinPhone UDP, or captive portal login, go back into this window and remove the leading comment ('#') from the appropriate lines (this is obviously one of the many aspects of this prototype that could benefit from real UI).</p>\n<p>Then, configure the apps you want to allow to access the network. Note that the only Android system apps that must access the network are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CM Updater</li>\n<li>Downloads, Media Storage, Download Manager</li>\n<li>F-Droid</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>Orbot's network access is handled via the main firewall-torify-all.sh script. You do not need to enable full network access to Orbot in Droidwall.</p>\n<p>The rest of the apps you can enable at your discretion. They will all be routed through Tor automatically.</p>\n<p>Once Droidwall is configured, you can click on the Menu (three dots) and click the \"Firewall Disabled\" button to enable the firewall. Then, you can enable Orbot. <b>Do not</b> grant Orbot superuser access. It still opens the transproxy ports you need without root, and Droidwall is managing installation of the transproxy rules, not Orbot.</p>\n<p>You are now ready to enable Wifi and network access on your device. For vulnerability surface reduction, you may want to use the <i>Advanced Options -> Static IP</i> to manually enter an IP address for your device to avoid using dhclient. You do not need a DNS server, and can safely set it to 127.0.0.1.</p>\n<p><a name=\"GoogleApps\"><br />\n<h1>Google Apps Setup</h1>\n<p></a></p>\n<p>If you installed the Google Apps zip, you need to do a few things now to set it up, and to further harden your device. If you opted out of Google Apps, you can skip to the <a href=\"#Software\">next section</a>.</p>\n<h2>Google Apps Setup: Initializing Google Play</h2>\n<p>The first time you use Google Play, you will need to enable four apps in Droidwall: \"<i>Google Account Manager, Google Play Services...</i>\",  \"<i>Settings, Dev Tools, Fused Location...</i>\", \"<i>Gmail</i>\", and \"<i>Google Play</i>\" itself.</p>\n<p>If you do not have a Google account, your best bet is to find open wifi to create one, as Google will often block accounts created through Tor, even if you use an Android device.</p>\n<p>After you log in for the first time, you should be able to disable the \"<i>Google Account Manager, Google Play Services...</i>\", \"<i>Gmail</i>\", and the \"<i>Settings...</i>\" apps in Droidwall, but your authentication tokens in Google Play may expire periodically. If this happens, you should only need to temporarily enable the \"<i>Google Account Manager, Google Play Services...</i>\" app in Droidwall to obtain new ones.</p>\n<h2>Google Apps Setup: Mitigating the Google Play Backdoors</h2>\n<p>If you do choose to use Google Play, you need to be very careful about how you allow it to access the network. In addition to the risks associated with using a proprietary App Store that can send you targeted malware-infected packages based on your Google Account, it has at least two major user experience flaws:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Anyone who is able to gain access to your Google account can <a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/02/04/android-market-web-store-backdoor-phone-hackers/\">silently install</a> root or full permission apps without any user interaction what-so-ever. Once installed, these apps can retroactively clear what little installation notification and UI-based evidence of their existence there was in the first place.\n</li>\n<li>The Android Update Process does not inform the user of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/19/android-upgrades-open-a-backdoor-to-malware-researchers-show/\">changes in permissions</a> of pending update apps that happen to get installed after an Android upgrade.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br>The first issue can be mitigated by ensuring that Google Play does not have access to the network when not in use, by disabling it in Droidwall. If you do not do this, apps can be installed silently behind your back. Welcome to the Google Experience.</p>\n<p>For the second issue, you can install the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iu.seccheck\">SecCheck</a> utility, to monitor your apps for changes in permissions during a device upgrade.</p>\n<h2>Google Apps Setup: Disabling Google Cloud Messaging</h2>\n<p>If you have installed the Google Apps zip, you have also enabled a feature called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Messaging\">Google Cloud Messaging</>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/google/gcm/index.html\">Google Cloud Messaging Service</a> allows apps to register for asynchronous remote push notifications from Google, as well as send outbound messages through Google. </p>\n<p>Notification registration and outbound messages are sent via the app's own UID, so using Droidwall to disable network access by an app is enough to prevent outbound data, and notification registration. However, if you ever allow network access to an app, and it does successfully register for notifications, these notifications can be delivered even when the app is once again blocked from accessing the network by Droidwall.</p>\n<p>These inbound notifications can be blocked by disabling network access to the \"<i>Google Account Manager, Google Play Services, Google Services Framework, Google Contacts Sync</i>\" in Droidwall. In fact, the only reason you should ever need to enable network access by this service is if you need to log in to Google Play again if your authentication tokens ever expire.</p>\n<p>If you would like to test your ability to control Google Cloud Messaging, there are two apps in the Google Play store than can help with this. <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iapplize.gcm.test\">GCM Test</a> allows for simple send and receive pings through GCM. <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.firstrowria.pushnotificationtester\">Push Notification Tester</a> will allow you to test registration and asynchronous GCM notification.</p>\n<p><a name=\"Software\"><br />\n<h2>Recommended Privacy and Auditing Software</h2>\n<p></a></p>\n<p>Ok, so now that we have locked down our Android device, now for the fun bit: secure communications!</p>\n<p>We recommend the following apps from <a href=\"https://f-droid.org\">F-Droid</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=xabber&amp;fdid=com.xabber.androiddev\">Xabber</a></li>\n<p>Xabber is a full Java implementation of XMPP, and supports both OTR and Tor. Its UI is a bit more streamlined than Guardian Project's <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=info.guardianproject.otr.app.im\">ChatSecure</a>, and it does not make use of any native code components (which are more vulnerable to code execution exploits than pure Java code). Unfortunately, this means it lacks some of ChatSecure's nicer features, such as push-to-talk voice and file transfer.\n </p>\n<p>\nDespite better protection against code execution, it does have several insecure default settings. In particular, you want to make the following changes:\n </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Notifications -> Message text in Notifications -> Off (notifications can be read by other apps!)</li>\n<li>Accounts -> Integration into system accounts -> Off</li>\n<li>Accounts -> Store message history -> Don't Store</li>\n<li>Security -> Store History -> Off</li>\n<li>Security -> Check Server Certificate</li>\n<li>Chat -> Show Typing Notifications -> Off</li>\n<li>Connection Settings -> Auto-away -> disabled</li>\n<li>Connection Settings -> Extended away when idle -> Disabled</li>\n<li>Keep Wifi Awake -> On</li>\n<li>Prevent sleep Mode -> On</li>\n</ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=offline%20calendar&amp;fdid=org.sufficientlysecure.localcalendar\">Offline Calendar</a></li>\n<p>Offline Calendar is a hack to allow you to create a fake local Google account that does not sync to Google. This allows you to use the Calendar App without risk of leaking your activities to Google. Note that you must exempt both this app and Calendar from Privacy Guard for it to function properly.</p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=Linphone&amp;fdid=org.linphone\">LinPhone</a></li>\n<p>LinPhone is a FOSS SIP client that supports TCP TLS signaling and ZRTP. <b>Note that neither TLS nor ZRTP are enabled by default.</b> You must manually enable them in <i>Settings -> Network -> Transport and Settings -> Network -> Media Encryption</i>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ostel.co/\">ostel.co</a> is a free SIP service run by the Guardian Project that supports only TLS and ZRTP, but does not allow outdialing to normal PSTN telephone numbers. While Bitcoin has many privacy issues of its own, the Bitcoin community maintains a <a href=\"http://www.thebitcoinreview.com/sites.php?catid=2&amp;subcatid=12\">couple</a> <a href=\"http://www.bitcoiney.com/listings/category/voip-sms\">lists</a> of \"trunking\" providers that allow you to obtain a PSTN phone number in exchange for Bitcoin payment.</p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.morlunk.mumbleclient\">Plumble</a>\n<p>\nPlumble is a Mumble client that will route voice traffic over Tor, which is useful if you would like to communicate with someone over voice without revealing your IP to them, or your activity to a local network observer. However, unlike Linphone, voice traffic is not end-to-end encrypted, so the Mumble server can listen to your conversations.\n </p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.fsck.k9\">K-9 Mail</a> and <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.thialfihar.android.apg\">APG</a>\n<p>K-9 Mail is a POP/IMAP client that supports TLS and integrates well with APG, which will allow you to send and receive GPG-encrypted mail easily. Before using it, you should be aware of two things: It identifies itself in your mail headers, which opens you up to targeted attacks specifically tailored for K-9 Mail and/or Android, and by default it includes the subject of messages in mail notifications (which is bad, because other apps can read notifications). There is a privacy option to disable subject text in notifications, but there is no option to disable the user agent in the mail headers.</p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=osmand&amp;fdid=net.osmand.plus\">OSMAnd~</a></li>\n<p>A free offline mapping tool. While the UI is a little clunky, it does support voice navigation and driving directions, and is a handy, private alternative to Google Maps.</p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=vlc&amp;fdid=org.videolan.vlc\">VLC</a>\n<p>\nThe VLC port in F-Droid is a fully capable media player. It can play mp3s and most video formats in use today. It is a handy, private alternative to Google Music and other closed-source players that often report your activity to third party advertisers. VLC does not need network access to function.\n </p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=firefox&amp;fdid=org.mozilla.firefox\">Firefox</a></li>\n<p>We do not yet have a port of Tor Browser for Android (though one is underway -- see the Future Work section). Unless you want to use Google Play to get Chrome, Firefox is your best bet for a web browser that receives regular updates (the built in Browser app does not). <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\">HTTPS-Everywhere</a> and <a href=\"http://noscript.net/nsa/\">NoScript</a> are available, at least.</p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=bitcoin&amp;fdid=de.schildbach.wallet\">Bitcoin</a></li>\n<p>Bitcoin might not be the most private currency in the world. In fact, you might even say it's the least private currency in the world. But, it is a neat toy.\n  </p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=permissions&amp;fdid=com.adstrosoftware.launchappops\">Launch App Ops</a>\n<p>\n The Launch App Ops app is a simple shortcut into the hidden application permissions editor in Android. A similar interface is available through <i>Settings -> Privacy -> Privacy Guard</i>, but a direct shortcut to edit permissions is handy. It also displays some additional system apps that Privacy Guard omits.\n </p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=permissions&amp;fdid=com.FireFart.Permissions2\">Permissions</a>\n<p>The Permissions app gives you a view of all Android permissions, and shows you which apps have requested a given permission. This is particularly useful to disable the <i>record audio</i> permission for apps that you don't want to suddenly decide to listen to you. (Interestingly, the Record Audio permission disable feature was broken in all Android ROMs I tested, aside from Cyanogenmod 11. You can test this yourself by revoking the permission from the Sound Recorder app, and verifying that it cannot record.)\n </p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=catlog&amp;fdid=com.nolanlawson.logcat\">CatLog</a></li>\n<p>In addition to being supercute, CatLog is an excellent Android monitoring and debugging tool. It allows you to monitor and record the full set of Android log events, which can be helpful in diagnosing issues with apps.</p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=os%20monitor&amp;fdid=com.eolwral.osmonitor\">OS Monitor</a></li>\n<p>OS Monitor is an excellent Android process and connection monitoring app, that can help you watch for CPU usage and connection attempts by your apps.</p>\n<li><a href=\"https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=intent%20intercept&amp;fdid=uk.co.ashtonbrsc.android.intentintercept\">Intent Intercept</a></li>\n<p>Intent Intercept allows you to inspect and extract <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6578051/what-is-intent-in-android\">Android Intent</a> content without allowing it to get forwarded to an actual app. This is useful for monitoring how apps attempt to communicate with eachother, though be aware it only covers one of the <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-tips.html#IPC\">mechanisms of inter-app communication</a> in Android.\n</ol>\n<p><a name=\"Backup\"><br />\n<h1>Backing up Your Device Without Google</h1>\n<p></a></p>\n<p>Now that your device is fully configured and installed, you probably want to know how to back it up without sending all of your private information directly to Google. While the Team Win Recovery Project will back up all of your system settings and apps (even if your device is encrypted), it currently does not back up the contents of your virtualized /sdcard. Remembering to do a couple adb pulls of key directories can save you a lot of heartache should you suffer some kind of data loss or hardware failure (or simply drop your tablet on a bridge while in a rush to catch a train).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/backup.sh\">backup.sh script</a> uses adb to pull your Download and Pictures directories from the /sdcard, as well as pulls the entire TWRP backup directory.</p>\n<p>Before you use that script, you probably want to delete old TWRP backup folders so as to only pull one backup, to reduce pull time. These live in <b>/sdcard/TWRP/BACKUPS/</b>, which is also known as <b>/storage/emulated/0/TWRP/BACKUPS</b> in the File Manager app.</p>\n<p>To use this script over the network without a usb cable, enable both USB Debugging and ADB Over Network in your developer settings. The script does not require you to enable root access from adb, and you should not enable root because it takes quite a while to run a backup, especially if you are using network adb.</p>\n<p>Prior to using network adb, you must edit your Droidwall custom scripts to allow it (by removing the '#' in the <b>#. /data/local/firewall-allow-adb.sh</b> line you entered earlier), and then run the following commands from a non-root Linux shell on your desktop/laptop (the <i>ADB Over Network</i> setting will tell you the IP and port):</p>\n<pre>\nkillall adb\nadb connect ip:5555\n</pre><p>\n<b>VERY IMPORTANT</b>: Don't forget to disable <i>USB Debugging</i>, as well as the Droidwall adb exemption when you are done with the backup!</p>\n<p><a name=\"MicrophoneRemoval\"><br />\n<h1>Removing the Built-in Microphone</h1>\n<p></a></p>\n<p>If you would really like to ensure that your device cannot listen to you even if it is exploited, it turns out it is very straight-forward to remove the built-in microphone in the Nexus 7. There is only one mic on the 2013 model, and it is located just below the volume buttons (the tiny hole).</p>\n<p>To remove it, all you need to do is pop off the the back panel (this can be done with your fingernails, or a tiny screwdriver), and then you can shave the microphone right off that circuit board, and reattach the panel. I have done this to one of my devices, and it was subsequently unable to record audio at all, without otherwise affecting functionality.</p>\n<p>You can still use apps that require a microphone by plugging in headphone headset that contains a mic built in (these cost around $20 and you can get them from nearly any consumer electronics store). I have also tested this, and was still able to make a Linphone call from a device with the built in microphone removed, but with an external headset. Note that the 2012 Nexus 7 does <b>not</b> support these combination microphone+headphone jacks (and it has a secondary microphone as well). You must have the 2013 model.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG6A_RBX-v0&amp;html5=1\">2013 Nexus 7 Teardown video</a> can give you an idea of what this looks like before you try it. Again you do not need to fully disassemble the device - you only need to remove the back cover.</p>\n<p><b>Pro-Tip:</b> Before you go too crazy and start ripping out the cameras too, remember that you can cover the cameras with a sticker or tape when not in use. I have found that regular old black electrical tape applies seamlessly, is non-obvious to casual onlookers, and is easy to remove without smudging or gunking up the lenses. Better still, it can be removed and reapplied many times without losing its adhesive. </p>\n<p><a name=\"BasebandRemoval\"><br />\n<h1>Removing the Remnants of the Baseband</h1>\n<p></a></p>\n<p>There is one more semi-hardware mod you may want to make, though.</p>\n<p>It turns out that the 2013 Wifi Nexus 7 does actually have a partition that contains a cell network baseband firmware on it, located on the filesystem as the block device <b>/dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-name/radio</b>. If you run <b>strings</b> on that block device from the shell, you can see that all manner of CDMA and GSM log messages, comments, and symbols are present in that partition.</p>\n<p>According to ADB logs, Cyanogenmod 11 actually does try to bring up a cell network radio at boot on my Wifi-only Nexus 7, but fails due to it being disabled. There is also a strong economic incentive for Asus and Google to make it extremely difficult to activate the baseband even if the hardware is otherwise identical for manufacturing reasons, since they sell the WiFi-only version for $100 less. If it were easy to re-enable the baseband, HOWTOs would exist (which they do not seem to, at least not yet), and they would cut into their LTE device sales.</p>\n<p>Even so, since we lack public schematics for the Nexus 7 to verify that cell components are actually missing or hardware-disabled, it may be wise to wipe this radio firmware as well, as defense in depth.</p>\n<p>To do this, open the Terminal app, and run:</p>\n<pre>\nsu\ncd /dev/block/platform/msm_sdcc.1/by-name\ndd if=/dev/zero of=./radio\n</pre><p>\n<br>I have wiped that partition while the device was running without any issue, or any additional errors from ADB logs.</p>\n<p>Note that an anonymous commenter also suggested it is <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/mission-impossible-hardening-android-security-and-privacy#comment-55280\">possible to disable the baseband</a> of a cell-enabled device using a series of Android service disable commands, and by wiping that radio block device. I have not tested this on a device other than the WiFI-only Nexus 7, though, so proceed with caution. If you try those steps on a cell-enabled device, you should archive a copy of your radio firmware first by doing something like the following from that dev directory that contains the radio firmware block device.</p>\n<pre>\ndd if=./radio of=/sdcard/radio.img\n</pre><p>\n<br>If anything goes wrong, you can restore that image with:</p>\n<pre>\ndd if=/sdcard/radio.img of=./radio\n</pre><p>\n<a name=\"FutureWork\"><br />\n<h1>Future Work</h1>\n<p></a></p>\n<p>In addition to streamlining the contents of this post into a single additional Cyanogenmod installation zip or alternative ROM, the following problems remain unsolved.</p>\n<h2>Future Work: Better Usability</h2>\n<p>While arguably very secure, this system is obviously nowhere near usable. Here are some potential improvements to the user interface, based on a brainstorming session I had with another interested developer.</p>\n<p>First of all, the AFWall+/Droidwall UI should be changed to be a tri-state: It should allow you to send app traffic over Tor, over your normal internet connection, or block it entirely.</p>\n<p>Next, during app installation from either F-Droid or Google Play (this is an Intent another addon app can actually listen for), the user should be given the chance to decide if they would like that app's traffic to be routed over Tor, use the normal Internet connection, or be blocked entirely from accessing the network. Currently, the Droidwall default for new apps is \"no network\", which is a great default, but it would be nice to ask users what they would like to do during actual app installation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, users should also be given a chance to edit the app's permissions upon installation as well, should they desire to do so.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"#GoogleApps\">Google Play</a> situation could also be vastly improved, should Google itself still prove unwilling to improve the situation. Google Play could be wrapped in a launcher app that automatically grants it network access prior to launch, and then disables it upon leaving the window.</p>\n<p>A similar UI could be added to LinPhone. Because the actual voice and video transport for LinPhone does not use Tor, it is possible for an adversary to learn your SIP ID or phone number, and then call you just for the purposes of learning your IP.  Because we handle call setup over Tor, we can prevent LinPhone from performing any UDP activity, or divulging your IP to the calling party prior to user approval of the call. Ideally, we would also want to inform the user of the fact that incoming calls can be used to obtain information about them, at least prior to accepting their first call from an unknown party.</p>\n<h2>Future Work: Find Hardware with Actual Isolated Basebands</h2>\n<p>Related to usability, it would be nice if we could have a serious community effort to audit the baseband isolation properties of existing cell phones, so we all don't have to carry around these ridiculous battery packs and sketch-ass wifi bridges. There is no engineering reason why this prototype could not be just as secure if it were a single piece of hardware. We just need to find the right hardware.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/mission-impossible-hardening-android-security-and-privacy#comment-55372\">random commenter claimed that the Galaxy Nexus</a> might actually have exactly the type of baseband isolation we want, but the comment was from memory, and based on software reverse engineering efforts that were not publicly documented. We need to do better than this.</p>\n<h2>Future Work: Bug Bounty Program</h2>\n<p>If there is sufficient interest in this prototype, and/or if it gets transformed into a usable addon package or ROM, we may consider running a bug bounty program where we accept donations to a dedicated Bitcoin address, and award the contents of that wallet to anyone who discovers a Tor proxy bypass issue or remote code execution vulnerability in any of the network-enabled apps mentioned in this post (except for the Browser app, which does not receive security updates).</p>\n<h2>Future Work: Port Tor Browser to Android</h2>\n<p>The Guardian Project is undertaking <a href=\"https://github.com/guardianproject/orfox\">a port of Tor Browser to Android</a> as part of their <a href=\"https://dev.guardianproject.info/projects/google-summer-of-code/wiki/Orfox_-_Firefox-based_Privacy_Enhanced_Browser/1\">OrFox project</a>. This will greatly improve the privacy of your web browsing experience on the Android device over both Firefox and Chrome. We look forward to helping them in any way we can with this effort.</p>\n<h2>Future Work: WiFi MAC Address Randomization</h2>\n<p>It is actually possible to randomize the WiFi MAC address on the Google Nexus 7. The closed-source root app <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jworksbr.macspoofer\">Mac Spoofer</a> is able to modify the device MAC address using Qualcomm-specific methods in such a way that the entire Android OS becomes convinced that this is your actual MAC.</p>\n<p>However, doing this requires installation of a root-enabled, closed-source application from the Google Play Store, which we believe is extremely unwise on a device you need to be able to trust. Moreover, this app cannot be autorun on boot, and your MAC address will also reset every time you disable the WiFi interface (which is easy to do accidentally).  It also supports using only a single, manually entered MAC address.</p>\n<p>Hardware-independent techniques (such as a the Terminal command <b>busybox ifconfig wlan0 hw ether &lt;mac&gt;</b>) appear to interfere with the WiFi management system and prevent it from associating. Moreover, they do not cause the Android system to report the new MAC address, either (visible under <i>Settings -> About Tablet -> Status</i>).</p>\n<p>Obviously, an Open Source F-Droid app that properly resets (and automatically randomizes) the MAC every time the WiFi interface is brought up is badly needed.</p>\n<h2>Future Work: Disable Probes for Configured Wifi Networks</h2>\n<p>The Android OS currently probes for all of your configured WiFi networks while looking for open wifi to connect to. Configured networks should not be probed for explictly unless activity for their BSSID is seen. The xda-developers forum has a <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2683858\">limited fix to change scanning behavior</a>, but <a href=\"http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?s=5172139ce1f8c5a99e3ef4bfa471042a&amp;p=51268001&amp;postcount=4\">users report</a> that it does not disable the active probing behavior for any \"hidden\" networks that you have configured.</p>\n<h2>Future Work: Recovery ROM Password Protection</h2>\n<p>An unlocked recovery ROM is a huge vulnerability surface for Android. While disk encryption protects your applications and data, it does not protect many key system binaries and boot programs. With physical access, it is possible to modify these binaries through your recovery ROM.</p>\n<p>The ability to set a password for the Team Win recovery ROM in such a way that a simple \"<i>fastboot flash recovery</i>\" would overwrite would go a long way to improving device security. At least it would become evident to you if your recovery ROM has been replaced, in this case (due to the absence of the password).</p>\n<p>It may also be possible to <a href=\"https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/36830/whats-the-security-implication-of-having-an-unlocked-boot-loader\">restore your bootloader lock</a> as an alternative, but then you lose the ability to make backups of your system using Team Win.</p>\n<h2>Future Work: Disk Encryption via TPM or Clever Hacks</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, even disk encryption and a secure recovery firmware is not enough to fully defend against an adversary with an extended period of physical access to your device.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.extremetech.com/computing/150536-how-to-bypass-an-android-smartphones-encryption-and-security-put-it-in-the-freezer\">Cold Boot Attacks</a> are still very much a reality against any form of disk encryption, and the best way to eliminate them is through hardware-assisted secure key storage, such as through a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module\">TPM chip</a> on the device itself.</p>\n<p>It may also be possible to mitigate these attacks by placing key material in SRAM memory locations that will be overwritten as part of the <a href=\"http://rhombus-tech.net/allwinner_a10/a10_boot_process/\">ARM boot process</a>. If these physical memory locations are stable (and for ARM systems that use the SoC SRAM to boot, they will be), rebooting the device to extract key material will always end up overwriting it. Similar ARM CPU-based encryption defenses have also been <a href=\"http://www1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/filepool/projects/armored/armored.paper.pdf\">explored in the research literature</a>.</p>\n<h2>Future Work: Download and Build Process Integrity</h2>\n<p>Beyond the download integrity issues mentioned above, better build security is also <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise\">deeply needed</a> by all of these projects. A <a href=\"http://gitian.org/\">Gitian descriptor</a> that is capable of building Cyanogenmod and arbitrary F-Droid packages in a reproducible fashion is one way to go about <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details\">achieving this property</a>.</p>\n<h2>Future Work: Removing Binary Blobs</h2>\n<p>If you read the <a href=\"http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Build_for_flo\">Cyanogenmod build instructions</a> closely, you can see that it requires  extracting the binary blobs from some random phone, and shipping them out. This is the case with most ROMs. In fact, only the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicant_%28operating_system%29\">Replicant Project</a> seems concerned with this practice, but regrettably they do not support any wifi-only devices. This is rather unfortunate, because no matter what they do with the Android OS on existing cell-enabled devices, they will always be stuck with a closed source, backdoored baseband that has direct access to the microphone, if not the RAM and the entire Android OS.</p>\n<p>Kudos to them for <a href=\"http://redmine.replicant.us/projects/replicant/wiki/SamsungGalaxyBackdoor\">finding one of the backdoors</a> though, at least.</p>\n<p><a name=\"Changes\"><br />\n<h1>Changes Since Initial Posting</h1>\n<p></a></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Updated <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/android-firewall.zip\">firewall scripts</a> to fix <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/droidwall/issues/detail?id=260\">Droidwall permissions vulnerability</a>.</li>\n<li>Updated Applications List to recommend VLC as a free media player.</li>\n<li>Mention the Guardian Project's planned Tor Browser port (called OrFox) as Future Work.</li>\n<li>Mention disabling configured WiFi network auto-probing as Future Work</li>\n<li>Updated the <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/android-firewall/install-install.sh\">firewall install script</a> (and the <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~mikeperry/android-hardening/android-firewall.zip\">android-firewall.zip</a> that contains it) to disable \"Captive Portal detection\" connections to Google upon WiFi association.

    "content": "<p>A new OpenSSL vulnerability on 1.0.1 through 1.0.1f is out today, which <a href=\"https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2014-0160\">can be used to reveal memory to a connected client or server</a>. </p>\n<p>If you're using an older OpenSSL version, you're safe.</p>\n<p>Note that this bug affects way more programs than just Tor &mdash; expect everybody who runs an https webserver to be scrambling today. If you need strong anonymity or privacy on the Internet, you might want to stay away from the Internet entirely for the next few days while things settle.</p>\n<p>Here are our first thoughts on what Tor components are affected:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Clients</strong>: The browser part of Tor Browser shouldn't be affected, since it uses libnss rather than openssl. But the Tor client part is: Tor clients could possibly be induced to send sensitive information like \"what sites you visited in this session\" to your entry guards.  If you're using TBB we'll have new bundles out shortly; if you're using your operating system's Tor package you should get a new OpenSSL package and then be sure to manually restart your Tor. [update: the bundles are out, and you should upgrade]</li>\n<li><strong>Relays and bridges</strong>: Tor relays and bridges could maybe be made to leak their medium-term onion keys (rotated once a week), or their long-term relay identity keys. An attacker who has your relay identity key can publish a new relay descriptor indicating that you're at a new location (not a particularly useful attack). An attacker who has your relay identity key, has your onion key, and can intercept traffic flows to your IP address can impersonate your relay (but remember that Tor's <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#KeyManagement\">multi-hop design</a> means that attacking just one relay in the client's path is not very useful). In any case, best practice would be to update your OpenSSL package, discard all the files in keys/ in your DataDirectory, and restart your Tor to generate new keys. (You will need to update your MyFamily torrc lines if you run multiple relays.) [update: we've <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004362.html\">cut the vulnerable relays out of the network</a>]</li>\n<li><strong>Hidden services</strong>: Tor hidden services might leak their long-term hidden service identity keys to their guard relays. Like the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/debian-openssl-flaw%3A-what-does-it-mean-tor-clients%3F\">last big OpenSSL bug</a>, <strike>this shouldn't allow an attacker to identify the location of the hidden service</strike> [edit: if it's your entry guard that extracted your key, they know where they got it from]. Also, an attacker who knows the hidden service identity key can impersonate the hidden service. Best practice would be to move to a new hidden-service address at your convenience.</li>\n<li><strong>Directory authorities</strong>: In addition to the keys listed in the \"relays and bridges\" section above, Tor directory authorities might leak their medium-term authority signing keys. Once you've updated your OpenSSL package, you should generate a new signing key. Long-term directory authority identity keys are offline so should not be affected (whew). More tricky is that clients have your relay identity key hard-coded, so please don't rotate that yet. We'll see how this unfolds and try to think of a good solution there.</li>\n<li><strong>Tails</strong> is still tracking Debian oldstable, so it should not be affected by this bug.</li>\n<li><strong>Orbot</strong> looks vulnerable; they have some <a href=\"https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-April/003383.html\">new packages available for testing</a>.</li>\n<li>The webservers in the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" title=\"https://www.torproject.org/\">https://www.torproject.org/</a> rotation needed (and got) upgrades. Maybe we'll need to throw away our torproject SSL web cert and get a new one too.</li>\n</ol>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the fourteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>The Heartbleed Bug and Tor</h1>\n<p>OpenSSL bug <a href=\"https://www.openssl.org/news/vulnerabilities.html#2014-0160\">CVE-2014-0160</a>, also known as the <a href=\"http://heartbleed.com/\">Heartbleed bug</a>, “allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software”, potentially enabling the compromise of information including “user names and passwords, instant messages, emails, and business critical documents and communication”. Tor is one of the very many networking programs that use OpenSSL to communicate over the Internet, so within a few hours of the bug’s disclosure Roger Dingledine posted a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160\"> security advisory</a> describing how it affects different areas of the Tor ecosystem.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-April/032602.html\">“The short version is: upgrade your openssl”</a>. Tor Browser users should upgrade as soon as possible to the new <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-354-released\">3.5.4 release</a>, which includes OpenSSL 1.0.1g, fixing the vulnerability. “The browser itself does not use OpenSSL…however, this release is still considered an important security update, because it is theoretically possible to extract sensitive information from the Tor client sub-process”, wrote Mike Perry.</p>\n<p>Those using a system Tor should upgrade their OpenSSL version and manually restart their Tor process. For relay operators, “best practice would be to update your OpenSSL package, discard all the files in keys/ in your DataDirectory, and restart your Tor to generate new keys”, and for hidden service administrators, “to move to a new hidden-service address at your convenience”. Clients, relays, and services using an older version of OpenSSL, including Tails, are not affected by this bug.</p>\n<p>For mobile devices, Nathan Freitas <a href=\"https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-April/003383.html\">called for immediate testing</a> of Orbot 13.0.6-beta-3, which not only upgrades OpenSSL but also contains a fix for the transproxy leak <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-March/032503.html\">described by Mike Perry</a> two weeks ago, in addition to smaller fixes and improvements from <a href=\"https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-April/003375.html\">13.0.6-beta-1</a> and subsequently.

Events such as last month’s (short-lived) <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/03/when-tor-block-not-tor-block\">disruption of access to the main Tor Project website</a> from some Turkish internet connections have reaffirmed the need for multiple distribution channels that users can turn to during a censorship event in order to acquire a copy of the Tor Browser, secure their browsing, and beat the censors. One of the simplest ways of ensuring this is to make a copy of the entire website and put it somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Recent days have seen the establishment of a large number of new Tor website mirrors, for which thanks must go to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000497.html\">Max Jakob Maass</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000499.html\">Ahmad Zoughbi</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000500.html\">Darren Meyer</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000501.html\">Piratenpartei Bayern</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000505.html\">Bernd Fix</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000506.html\">Florian Walther</a>, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000507.html\">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (on a subdomain formerly housing the Tor Project’s official site), the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000508.html\">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000509.html\">Caleb Xu</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-March/000510.html\">George Kargiotakis</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-April/000512.html\">Tobias Markus</a>, as well as to all the mirror operators of <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/getinvolved/mirrors\">longer standing</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to participate in the effort to render blocking of the Tor website even more futile, please see the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/running-a-mirror\">instructions for running a mirror</a>, and then come to the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-mirrors\">tor-mirrors mailing list</a> to notify the community!</p>\n<h1>Mission Impossible: Hardening Android for Security and Privacy</h1>\n<p>On the Tor Blog, Mike Perry posted <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/mission-impossible-hardening-android-security-and-privacy\">another large and comprehensive hacking guide</a>, this time describing “the installation and configuration of a prototype of a secure, full-featured, Android telecommunications device with full Tor support, individual application firewalling, true cell network baseband isolation, and optional ZRTP encrypted voice and video support.” The walkthrough covers hardware selection and setup, recommended software, Google-free backups, and disabling the built-in microphone of a Nexus 7 tablet (with a screwdriver).</p>\n<p>As it stands, following this guide may require a certain level of patience, but as Mike wrote, “it is our hope that this work can be replicated and eventually fully automated, given a good UI, and rolled into a single ROM or ROM addon package for ease of use.

Enjoy the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/3.6-beta-2/\">update</a> and report any bug you may find.</p>\n<h1>Key rotation at every level</h1>\n<p>The “Heartbleed” issue forces system administrators to consider private keys of network-facing applications affected by the bug as compromised. As Tor has no shortage of private keys in <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git\">its design</a>, a serious number of new keys has to be generated.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004256.html\">prompted</a> relay operators to get new identity keys, “especially from the big relays, and we’ll be happier tolerating a couple of bumpy days while the network recovers”. Switching to a new relay identity key means that the relay is <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay\">seen as new</a> to the authorities again: they will lose their Guard status and bandwidth measurement. It seems that a number of operators followed the advice, as <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=bandwidth&amp;start=2014-04-01&amp;end=2014-04-15#bandwidth\">the network lost around 1 Gbit/s of advertised capacity between April 7th and April 10th</a>.</p>\n<p>For a brighter future if such massive RSA1024 relay key migration is ever again in order, Nick Mathewson wrote <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/230-rsa1024-relay-id-migration.txt\">proposal 230</a>. The proposal describes a mechanism for relays to advertise their old identity to directory authorities and clients.</p>\n<p>Directory authorities can currently tie a relay’s nickname to its identity key with the Named flag. That feature proved to be less helpful than it seemed, and can subject its users to impersonation attacks. As relays switch to new identity keys, those who keep the same name will lose their Named flag for the next six months. So now <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004254.html\">seems</a> a good time to “throw out the Named and Unnamed flags entirely”. Sebastian Hahn acted on the idea and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006671.html\">started a draft proposal</a>.</p>\n<p>How should potentially compromised relays which have not switched to a new key be handled? On April 8th, grarpamp <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004259.html\">observed</a> that more than 3000 relays had been restarted — hopefully to use the fixed version of OpenSSL. It is unknown how many of those relays have switched to a new key since. Andrea Shepard has been working on a <a href=\"http://charon.persephoneslair.org/~andrea/private/tor-heartbleed-survey/\">survey</a> to identify them. What is known though are relays that are unfortunately still vulnerable. Sina Rabbani has set up a <a href=\"https://encrypted.redteam.net/bleeding_edges/\">visible list for guards and exits</a>. To protect Tor users, directory authority operators have started to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004336.html\">reject descriptors for vulnerable relays</a>.</p>\n<p>The identity keys for directory authorities are kept offline. But they are used to certify medium-term signing keys. Roger Dingledine’s<br />\n<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006663.html\">analysis</a> reports “two (moria1 and urras) of the directory authorities were unaffected by the openssl bug, and seven were affected”.</p>\n<p>At the time of writing, five of the seven affected authorities had new signing keys. In the meantime, Nick and Andrea have been busy writing code to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11464\">prevent the old keys from being accepted by Tor clients</a>.</p>\n<p>Changing the relay identity keys of the directory authorities has not been done so far “because current clients expect them to be at their current IP:port:fingerprint and would scream in their logs and refuse to connect if the relay identity key changes”. The specification of the missing piece of code to allow a smoother transition has been written by Nick Mathewson in <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/231-migrate-authority-rsa1024-ids.txt\">proposal 231</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/freenodestaff/status/455425032203022337\">hidden service operators are also generating new keys</a>. Unfortunately, this forces every user of the service to update the address in their bookmarks or configuration.</p>\n<p>As Roger summarized it: “fun times”.</p>\n<h1>More monthly status reports for March 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of March continued, with submissions from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000505.html\">Andrew Lewman</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000507.html\">Roger Dingledine</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000508.html\">Kelley Misata</a>.</p>\n<p>Roger also sent out the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000506.html\">report for SponsorF</a>, and the Tails team reported on <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2014_03/\">its progress</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>CVE-2014-0160 prompted Anthony Basile to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-April/032642.html\">release version 20140409</a> of Tor-ramdisk.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the sixteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Cutting out relays running version 0.2.2.x</h1>\n<p>Tor relays running the now ancient Tor 0.2.2.x are scheduled to be <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11149\">removed from the consensus</a>. The change has already been merged in the master branch and will be out with the next Tor 0.2.5 alpha.</p>\n<p>Even if most relay operators have been warned, the change has not yet been widely announced. But as three directory authorities are already not voting for the deprecated versions, the downtime of two others while cleaning up after the OpenSSL “Heartbleed” issue was sufficient to get these relays removed from the consensus <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html?graph=versions&amp;start=2014-04-01&amp;end=2014-04-23#versions\">for a couple of days</a>, as Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004422.html\">explained</a>.</p>\n<p>Eventually relays running versions prior to 0.2.3.16-alpha might also be removed from the consensus. “I think 0.2.3.16-alpha’s fix of #6033 makes that one a plausible ’not below this one’ cutoff”, Roger writes in the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11149#comment:7\">relevant Trac entry</a>.</p>\n<p>Relay operators should always make sure to run a <a href=\"https://consensus-health.torproject.org/#recommendedversions\">recommended Tor version</a>. The <a href=\"https://weather.torproject.org/subscribe/\">Tor Weather service</a> can be used by relay operators to get email notifications if an outdated version is detected.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Nathan Freitas <a href=\"https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-April/003436.html\">announced</a> the third (and probably final) release candidate for Orbot 13.0.6: “The big improvements in this build are a fix for the disconnected UI/activity (Tor is on, but UI shows off), and improvements to the transparent proxying iptables scripts”.</p>\n<p>The Tails developers put out two calls for testing: the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/test_1.0-rc1/index.en.html\">first</a> is for the first release candidate of Tails 1.0; while the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/test_UEFI/index.en.html\">second</a> is for UEFI support, which “allows you to start Tails using a USB stick on recent hardware, and especially on Mac”. “Test wildly”, and report any bugs you find!</p>\n<p>Andrea Shepard <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004340.html\">sent</a> a list of 1777 fingerprints for relays “which have ever turned up as potentially exposed by Heartbleed”. It appears that enough directory authority operators now <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004362.html\">reject relays known to be problematic</a>: sssheep <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-April/032762.html\">reported</a> that the still-vulnerable section of the network was down to 0.01% of the consensus weight.</p>\n<p>Mick <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004414.html\">drew attention</a> to the fact that in its current state, <a href=\"https://www.atagar.com/arm/\">arm</a> — the command-line relay status monitor — wrongly advises relay operators to run it with the same user as Tor, in order to access information about the relay’s connections. This is in fact a very bad idea, and a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10702\">ticket</a> is already open to address this issue. Lunar <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004412.html\">detailed</a> the correct method of doing this, which is also explained in the ticket.</p>\n<p>On the tor-relays mailing list, David Stainton <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004373.html\">mentioned</a> his <a href=\"https://github.com/david415/ansible-tor\">Tor role</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.ansible.com/\">Ansible automation tool</a>. David hoped that “relay operators will find this useful for deploying and maintaining large numbers of Tor relays and bridges”. The documentation specifies that it currently works with Debian and Ubuntu systems, and contains several configuration examples.</p>\n<p>David Fifield continued his progress on <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a>, a pluggable transport “that routes your traffic through a third-party web service in a way that should be difficult to block”. David sent a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006718.html\">call for wider testing</a> of experimental Tor Browser builds and a call for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006719.html\">reviews of the code</a>. “There are a lot of components that make up the meek transport […] This is your chance to get in on the ground floor of a new transport!”</p>\n<p>Ximin Luo <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006689.html\">raised</a> several points regarding how “indirect” pluggable transports like <a href=\"http://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/\">flashproxy</a> or meek are currently handled by Tor. Whereas obfs3 or ScrambleSuit connect directly to the specified peer, transforming the data flow along the way, Ximin describes meek and flashproxy as providing “the metaphor of connecting to a global homogeneous service”. The latter being “incompatible with the metaphor of connecting to a specific endpoint”. Solutions on how to make the design, code, and configuration better are up for discussion.</p>\n<p>Nicolas Vigier submitted his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000510.html\">status report for March</a>.</p>\n<p>Philipp Winter <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/call-papers-foci14-workshop\">relayed</a> the call for papers for the <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/conference/foci14/call-for-papers\">4th USENIX Workshop on Free and Open Communications on the Internet</a>. The workshop will be held on August 18th, and should bring together the wider community of researchers and practitioners interested in Tor and other ways to study, detect, or circumvent censorship. Papers have to be submitted before May 13th.</p>\n<p>Fabio Pietrosanti <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006723.html\">wondered</a> whether anyone had “ever tried to start Tor from a Python application using Ctypes”, making it possible to “sandbox the Python application using AppArmor without enabling any kind of execve() call”.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Many people email the Tor Help Desk from behind restrictive university firewalls that require them to connect using a proxy. Often these firewalls, Cyberoam and Fortiguard are two examples, use Deep Packet Inspection and block Tor traffic. Unfortunately Tor Browser users can’t use a proxy to connect to the internet and also use a pluggable transport. The Tor Browser team plans to include this capability in a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/8402\">future release</a>.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, harmony, Matt Pagan, and an anonymous contributor.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the seventeenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor 0.2.5.4-alpha is released</h1>\n<p>The latest incarnation of the current development branch of Tor, dubbed 0.2.5.4-alpha, was <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-April/032817.html\">released on April 26th</a>. This release brings mainly security and performance improvements for clients and relays.</p>\n<p>As a preventive measure (there being no evidence that the keys have been compromised), authority signing keys that were used while susceptible to the OpenSSL “heartbleed” bug are now blacklisted.</p>\n<p>Other improvements include fixing two expensive functions on busy relays, better TLS ciphersuite preference lists, support for run-time hardening on compilers that support <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/\">AddressSanitizer</a>, and more work on the Linux sandbox code. There are also several usability fixes for clients (especially clients that use bridges), two new TransPort protocols supported (one on OpenBSD, one on FreeBSD), and various other bugfixes.</p>\n<p>As Nick Mathewson wrote: “This release marks end-of-life for Tor 0.2.2.x; those Tor versions have accumulated many known flaws”.</p>\n<p>Source code is available at the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">usual location</a> and binary packages have already started to be updated.</p>\n<h1>Introducing the 2014 Google Summer of Code projects</h1>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-google-summer-code-2014\">announced in February</a>, Tor is once again participating in Google’s Summer of Code program, allowing students and aspiring developers the chance to work on a Tor-related project with funding from Google and expert guidance from Tor Project members. After several months of coordination and discussion, this summer’s successful proposals have now been chosen, and some of the students took to the tor-dev mailing list to introduce themselves and their upcoming work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006739.html\">Juha Nurmi</a> will continue to work on the already-operational ahmia.fi hidden service search engine, while <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006741.html\">Marc Juarez</a> will be “implementing the building blocks for a future padding-based website fingerprinting countermeasure as a pluggable transport”. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006744.html\">Daniel Martí</a> has taken up the challenge of <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/refs/heads/master:/proposals/140-consensus-diffs.txt\">implementing proposal 140</a>, which aims to considerably reduce the size of the network consensus data that Tor clients fetch every hour, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006745.html\">Israel Leiva</a> plans to spruce up the neglected GetTor service, which allows users to download the Tor Browser Bundle even if the Tor website and its mirrors are inaccessible. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006748.html\">Amogh Pradeep</a> will be contributing to the Guardian Project’s development of Orfox, a new Android web browser to be used with Orbot, while <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006749.html\">Kostas Jakeliunas</a> returns to Tor GSoC to construct a new BridgeDB distributor, serving bridge addresses to users in censored areas over Twitter, and possibly other channels as well.  <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006777.html\">Quinn Jarrell</a> will be working on building a pluggable transports combiner that “will allow transports to be chained together to form more varieties of transports and make them harder to detect and block”. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006752.html\">Sreenatha Bhatlapenumarthi</a> will pick up the effort of rewriting Tor Weather.</p>\n<p>You can read more about each proposal in the respective introductory messages and their replies; a full list of accepted projects is available on the <a href=\"https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org2/google/gsoc2014/tor\">Google Summer of Code website</a>. As Daniel wrote, “comments are very welcome”!</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Meejah <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006766.html\">released version 0.9.2 of txtorcon</a> — the Tor controller library for the Twisted Python framework: “this release adds a few minor bug-fixes and a few API enhancements”.</p>\n<p>The Tails team is <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-testers/2014-April/000010.html\">looking for enthusiasts equipped with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse</a> to ensure that Tails works properly with such hardware.</p>\n<p>Matthew Finkel forwarded a copy of the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-April/004428.html\">email that was sent to bridge operators </a> to warn them about the “Heartbleed” vulnerability, and the actions that should be taken as a result. If you know any bridge operator who might not have filled in their contact information, please forward the message!</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing has been working on switching Onionoo — the web service to retrieve information about the Tor network — to use the Gson library instead of plain string concatenation to format its JSON output. As the change might break some applications, client authors should <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006772.html\">test their applications</a> and see if everything still works as it should.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>The help desk has been asked why the Tor Project’s hidden service site mirrors are offline. The sites were taken down during the fallout from the Heartbleed security vulnerability. New hidden service addresses were not generated. The sysadmin team has expressed that they <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11567\">no longer wish to maintain these services</a>.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>Kristopher Ives is working on a card game using Tor. Each user accepts inbound connections through hidden services, and <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1592/88\">also needs to make outbound connections</a>. Tom Ritter acknowledged it was possible to use only one Tor daemon to do both.</p>\n<p>Dan <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/2012/88\">gets the error message “Cannot load XPCOM” whenever Tor Browser is started</a>. Jens Kubieziel pointed to the discussion at <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10789\">#10789</a>.  The culprit is WebRoot Internet Security as it prevents the proper loading of all browser components; either <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-352-released#comment-47052\">uninstalling it or adding DLL files to the whitelist has helped other users</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, harmony, Matt Pagan, qbi, and Karsten Loesing.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the eighteenth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser 3.6 is released</h1>\n<p>The long-awaited <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-36-released\">Tor Browser 3.6 was finally declared stable</a> on April 29th. Tor Browser 3.6 is the first version to fully integrate pluggable transports, enabling easier access to the Tor network on censored networks. The browser is based on the latest Firefox ESR 24.5.0 and <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.5\">includes a new round of security fixes</a>.</p>\n<p>When configuring how to access the Tor network, users can now select one of the included list of <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt\">obfs3</a> or <a href=\"https://fteproxy.org/\">fte</a> bridges. Using Flashproxy is also an option, but <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/FlashProxyHowto\">often requires further configuration</a> on the local firewall and router. Manually specifying <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/\">bridges</a> is still an option, now with support for the aforementioned pluggable transports.</p>\n<p>Many small usability enhancements have been made: Tor error messages are translated, the wording on several dialog windows has been improved based on user feedback, and Mac users now install the browser from the usual disk image format. Turkish localization has also been enabled.</p>\n<p>Read the release announcement for a complete changelog. Be sure to <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html\">upgrade</a>!</p>\n<h1>Tails 1.0 is out</h1>\n<p>“Version 1.0 is often an important milestone that denotes the maturity of a free software project. The first public version of what would become Tails was released on June 23 2009 […]. That was almost five years ago. Tails 1.0 marks the 36th stable release since then.”</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.0/\">release announcement</a> could have not said it better. On top of the simple idea of having a system entirely running in memory that guarantees Tor usage for all network connections, Tails has been extended with an USB installer, automatic upgrades, persistence, support for Tor bridges, MAC address spoofing, an extensive and translated documentation and <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/features/\">many more features</a>.</p>\n<p>Over Tails 0.23, the new version brings security fixes from Firefox and <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11464\">Tor</a>, an updated I2P, several enhancements to the Tor configuration interface, and the appearance of the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/promote/logo/\">new Tails logo</a>.</p>\n<p>More details are in the release announcement. For those who have not made use of the integrated updater, time to <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/download/\">download</a> the new version!</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for April 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of April has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000511.html\">Georg Koppen</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-April/000513.html\">Arthur D.

You can check <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/about/openpgp_keys/\">the real keys</a> used to sign Tails software on the Tails website.</p>\n<p>Erinn Clark <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006809.html\">alerted</a> users of the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/\">Trac-based Tor wiki</a> to the fact that a bug (now fixed) made it possible to register an account with an already-taken username, “overwriting the existing user’s password and thereby taking over the account”. “We recommend users try to login and if you find you are unable to do so, you can reset your password” on the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/reset_password\">appropriate Trac page</a>.</p>\n<p>Following up on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005556.html\">previous discussions</a> and a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-October/005674.html\">proposal</a> on the topic of how to make hidden services scale, Christopher Baines went on and implemented a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-April/006788.html\">prototype</a>, “for one possible design of how to allow distribution in hidden services”. The code and concrete design is up for feedback.</p>\n<p>Daniel Martí <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006792.html\">sent out</a> a list of proposed revisions — arrived at in discussion with other developers on IRC — to the now slightly outdated proposal 140, which forms the basis of his upcoming Google Summer of Code project to implement consensus diffs and so reduce the amount of information downloaded hourly by Tor clients. Among the proposals are support for microdescriptor consensus diffs and a time limit to prevent the leak of information about when Tor was last used; “ideas about what might be missing or needing an update are welcome”, wrote Daniel.</p>\n<p>Alpha releases of Orbot v14 are <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032847.html\">now available</a> for testing.

These include blocking all authority signing keys that may have been affected by the OpenSSL ‘heartbleed’ bug, choosing a far more secure set of TLS ciphersuites by default, closing a couple of memory leaks that could be used to run a target relay out of RAM, and several others.”</p>\n<p>For more details, look at the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/2ee56e4c2:/ChangeLog\">full changelog</a>. The source is available at the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">usual location</a>. Packages should be coming shortly, if not <a href=\"http://packages.qa.debian.org/t/tor/news/20140517T102023Z.html\">already available</a>.</p>\n<h1>Digital Restrictions Management and Firefox</h1>\n<p>Mozilla’s decision to <a href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/reconciling-mozillas-mission-and-w3c-eme/\">support playing media with digital restrictions</a> in Firefox by implementing the W3C EME specification has raised a fair amount of controversy. Paul Crable <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032947.html\">wanted to know</a> what it meant for the Tor Browser.</p>\n<p>Mike Perry <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032985.html\">answered</a> that “simply removing the DRM will be trivial, and it will be high on our list of tasks”.</p>\n<p>But he also explained his worries regarding a “per-device unique identifier” that Firefox would provide as part of the implementation: “it is likely that this identifier will soon be abused by all sorts of entities, […] quickly moving on to the advertising industry (why not play a short device-linked DRM video with your banner ad? You get a persistent, device-specific tracking identifier as part of the deal!). I think it is also quite likely that many arbitrary sites will actually deny access to users who do not provide them with such a device-id, if only due to ease of increased revenue generation from a fully identified userbase.”</p>\n<p>Mike has <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.privacy/3jA9zt1pXVo\">raised the issue</a> on Mozilla’s dev-privacy mailing-list where Henri Sivonen replied that device-identifying information will be hashed together with a “per-origin browser-generated secret“ that “persists until the user asks the salt to be forgotten”. So it does not look as gloom as it initially appeared. As always, the devil is in the details.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>David Goulet <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006872.html\">reported</a> on the status of the development of Torsocks 2.0, the library for safely using applications with Tor.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/10-years-collecting-tor-directory-data\">posted</a> on the Tor Blog to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the first archived Tor directory, and discussed the different ways in which the public archive of directory data is being used for research and development.</p>\n<p>Karsten also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006884.html\">notified</a> the community of a change in the compression algorithm used for the tarballs of archived metrics data, which has reduced their total size from 212 gigabytes to 33 — an 85% gain!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gnunet.org/knock\">Knock</a> is a variant of port-knocking that might be useful in the future for pluggable transports. “As Knock uses two fields in the TCP header in order to hide information and we explicitly want to be compatible with machines sitting in typical home networks”, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006873.html\">writes</a> Julian Kirsch, “we thus created a program which tests if Knock would work in your environment.” Please <a href=\"https://gnunet.org/knock_nat_tester\">give it a try</a> to help the team figure out if Knock could be deployed in the wild.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-May/000581.html\">Jesse Victors</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-May/000589.html\">Andrea</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-May/000592.html\">Nicholas Merrill</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-May/000594.html\">Martin A.</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project website!</p>\n<p>Michael Schloh von Bennewitz has been busy analyzing a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9701\">disk leak</a> in Tor Browser: when one copies a significant chunk of text to the clipboard, a temporary file is created with its content. Michael found a possible fix and is <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006875.html\">welcoming reviews</a>.</p>\n<p>Nicolas Vigier has been <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tbb-dev/2014-May/000050.html\">investigating</a> some extra connections made by the Tor Browser on startup to the local resolver and the default port or the SOCKS proxy.</p>\n<p>Shawn Nock proved us once more that talking to ISP is key to run Tor relays on high-speed links. Shawn’s exit node was <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-May/004553.html\">abruptly shut down by its provider</a> on May 15th. After a well-crafted plea explaining why Tor is important, the provider <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-May/004555.html\">restored the service</a> on the very same day!</p>\n<p>However, dope457 reported that their provider is now giving them <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-May/004562.html\">trouble for being the operator of a non-exit relay</a>, due to a large amount of traffic on the DNS port (53), which is being used as the ORPort by a <a href=\"https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/44EFAF942314F756FC7EA50292D5B383E568A9BD\">recently-established Tor relay</a>, as <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-May/004563.html\">pointed out</a> by Roman Mamedov.</p>\n<p>Now that ICANN is “selling” top-level domain names, Anders Andersson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032974.html\">raised concerns</a> about the .onion extension used by Tor. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6761\">RFC6761</a> defines a process regarding special-use domain names. Last November, Christian Grothoff, Matthias Wachs, Hellekin O.  Wolf, and Jacob Appelbaum submitted a <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-grothoff-iesg-special-use-p2p-names-02\">request to reserve several TLDs used in peer-to-peer systems</a>. Hellekin <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/032983.html\">sent an update</a> about the procedure: “the current status quo from the IETF so far is that this issue is not a priority”.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Local antivirus or firewall applications can prevent Tor from connecting unless they are disabled. Firewall tools that have caused usability issues in the past include Webroot SecureAnywhere AV, Kaspersky Internet Security 2012, Sophos Antivirus for Mac, and Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/\">Tor StackExchange site</a> now provides more than 1000 answers to user-supplied questions. However, there are still <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/unanswered\">~130 questions</a> which need a good answer, so if you happen to know one then please visit the site and help out.</p>\n<p>The majority of the questions are about the <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/tor-browser-bundle\">Tor Browser Bundle</a>, but <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hidden-services\">hidden services</a> also attract a large amount of attention.

All your questions about Tor and related software are welcome.</p>\n<p>Blue_Pyro uses Orweb on a mobile phone and <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1753/88\">wants to save images from websites</a>. Abel of Guardian recommended two options: first, a user can use <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/apps/firefoxprivacy/\">Firefox mobile with privacy enhanced options</a>, or one can <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/builds/Orfox/latest/\">try Orfox</a>, a development version of a Firefox-based browser.</p>\n<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/\">Stem</a> is a Python controller library for Tor. It comes with tutorials and generally has pretty good test coverage. The newly-added example scripts, however, don’t yet have unit tests. Damian Johnson suggested ways to <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11335\">add unit tests for example scripts</a>; if you want to help out, <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/stem.git\">learn how to get started</a>, start writing unit tests for the example scripts, and then comment on the ticket.</p>\n<p>The traffic obfuscator <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html\">obfsproxy</a> should <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9823\">validate command-line arguments appropriately</a>. Right now, it’s printing an error and continuing, but it should really abort. This sounds like a trivial change, but maybe there’s more to fix in the nearby code. If you like Python and want to give it a try, there’s more information for you on the ticket.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, harmony, Matt Pagan, Karsten Loesing, qbi, and Georg Koppen.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the twenty-first issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>OnionShare and tor’s ControlPort</h1>\n<p>Micah Lee published <a href=\"https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare\">OnionShare</a>, a program that “makes it simple to share a file securely using a password-protected Tor hidden service”. It originally ran only in Tails, but has now been made compatible with other GNU/Linux distros, Windows, and OS X. As part of that process, Micah <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006895.html\">wondered</a> about the best way to make the program work with a Tor Browser or system tor process, as “I would really like to not be in the business of distributing Tor myself”. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006896.html\">meejah</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006899.html\">David Stainton</a> responded with relevant details of the <a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/\">Stem</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/meejah/txtorcon\">txtorcon</a> controller libraries, which allow this kind of operation to take place via tor’s ControlPort.</p>\n<h1>The “Tor and HTTPS” visualization made translatable</h1>\n<p>Lunar <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/033001.html\">announced</a> the creation of a <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~lunar/tor-and-https/\">repository</a> for an SVG+Javascript version of the EFF’s interactive <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https/\">“Tor and HTTPS” visualization</a>, which has proven useful in explaining to users the types of data that can be leaked or intercepted, and by whom, when using Tor or HTTPS (or both, or neither). As Lunar wrote, “The good news is that it’s translatable”: copies have so far been published in over twenty languages. The amount of translation required is very small, so if you’d like to contribute in your language then download the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/lunar/tor-and-https.git/blob/HEAD:/tor-and-https.pot\">POT file</a> and submit a patch!</p>\n<h1>A Child’s Garden of Pluggable Transports</h1>\n<p>David Fifield <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006891.html\">published</a> <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/AChildsGardenOfPluggableTransports\">“A Child’s Garden of Pluggable Transports”</a>, a detailed visualization of different pluggable transport protocols, including “aspects of different transports that I think are hard to intuit, such as what flash proxy rendezvous looks like, and how transports look under the encrypted layer that is visible to a censor”. A few <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports\">other transports supported by Tor</a> are not yet discussed in the guide; “if you know how to run any of those transports, and you know an effective way to visualize it, please add it to the page”, wrote David.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Anthony G. Basile <a href=\"http://opensource.dyc.edu/pipermail/tor-ramdisk/2014-May/000131.html\">released</a> version 20140520 of <a href=\"http://opensource.dyc.edu/tor-ramdisk\">tor-ramdisk</a>, the micro Linux distribution “whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that maximizes security and privacy”. The new version upgrades Tor to version 0.2.4.22, which “adds an important block to authority signing keys that were used on authorities vulnerable to the “heartbleed” bug in OpenSSL”, among other fixes; upgrading “is strongly recommended”.</p>\n<p>Cure53 <a href=\"https://cure53.de/pentest-report_onion-browser.pdf\">audited the security</a> of the <a href=\"https://mike.tig.as/onionbrowser/\">Onion Browser</a>, a web browser for iOS platforms tunneling traffic through Tor. From the conclusion: “we believe that the Onion Browser project is on the right track, however there is still a long way ahead for the project to be appropriately ‘ripe’ for usage in actually privacy-relevant and critically important scenarios.” All reported issues should have been fixed in <a href=\"https://mike.tig.as/onionbrowser/security/#v1_5\">release 1.5</a> on May 14th.</p>\n<p>A new pluggable transport, currently named <a href=\"https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4\">obfs4</a>, is being crafted by Yawning Angel: “obfs4 is ScrambleSuit with djb crypto. Instead of obfs3 style UniformDH and CTR-AES256/HMAC-SHA256, obfs4 uses a combination of Curve25519, Elligator2, HMAC-SHA256, XSalsa20/Poly1305 and SipHash-2-4”. The feature set offered by obfs4 is comparable to ScrambleSuit, with minor differences. Yawning is now asking the community for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006897.html\">comments, reviews, and tests</a>.</p>\n<p>Stem now offers a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-feature-tor-interpreter\">control interpreter</a>, “a new method for interacting with Tor’s control interface that combines an interactive python interpreter with raw access similar to telnet”. Damian Johnson wrote a <a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/tutorials/down_the_rabbit_hole.html\">new tutorial</a> to give an overview of what can be done with it.</p>\n<p>Also on the controller front, Yawning Angel hacked on <a href=\"https://github.com/yawning/or-applet\">or-applet</a>, a Gtk+ system tray applet to monitor Tor circuits.</p>\n<p>Arlo Breault is making progress on the Tor Instant Messenger Bundle: a minimalistic <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11533\">user interface for OTR encryption in Instantbird</a>, one of the key features missing from the finished software, has now been implemented.</p>\n<p>Nicolas Vigier has been <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006911.html\">working</a> on improving the <a href=\"https://github.com/tsgates/mbox/\">Mbox sandboxing environment</a> to test the Tor Browser for disk or network leaks.</p>\n<p>Israel Leiva <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006903.html\">published</a> the initial version of a <a href=\"https://github.com/ileiva/gettor/blob/master/spec/overview.txt\">design proposal</a> for the “Revamp GetTor” Google Summer of Code project, having concluded that a full rewrite is needed.</p>\n<p>Juha Nurmi submitted the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-May/000536.html\">first weekly report</a> for the ahmia.fi GSoC project.</p>\n<p>kzhm <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-May/033032.html\">sent out</a> instructions for installing obfsproxy on Fedora 20, to go with <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy-instructions.html\">those for other Linux distributions</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer\">AddressSanitizer</a> (ASan) is a powerful memory error detector: software built with such technology makes it a lot harder to exploit programming errors related to memory management. Happily, Georg Koppen has <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-May/000414.html\">announced</a> the first test packages of the Tor Browser built with ASan hardening.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing is planning on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-May/006909.html\">spinning off the directory archive from the metrics portal</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Multiple Mac OS X users complained that despite seeing the “Congratulations” welcome page, they were unable to reach any website with the Tor Browser. It appears that with a recent update, the Sophos anti-virus solution interferes with the Tor Browser. In order to be able to use the Tor Browser again, one must open Sophos Anti-Virus, then “Preferences”, and in the “Web Protection” panel position all switches to off.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>yohann2008 doesn’t want their hidden service to be <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/2130/88\">indexed by search engines</a>. puser suggested using a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard\">robots.txt file</a>, as on a normal webpage. Jens Kubieziel later received confirmation on the IRC channel of <a href=\"https://ahmia.fi/\">ahmia.fi</a> that this search engine does indeed respect the robots.txt; however, it is unknown whether others do.</p>\n<p>Herbalist saw the <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/1866/88\">following line in their log file</a> and wonders what it could mean: “Rejecting INTRODUCE1 on non-OR or non-edge circuit 7503”. If you can unravel this mystery, please submit your answer to the question.</p>\n<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>\n<p>The metrics website displays graphs on <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html#userstats-bridge-transport\">bridge users by pluggable transport</a>, but we’d like to have another graph with <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11799\">total pluggable transport usage</a>. Karsten Loesing outlined the steps for adding such a graph, which require some knowledge of R and ggplot2. If you enjoy writing R and want to add this new graph to the metrics website, give it a try and post your results on the ticket.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, harmony, qbi, and Karsten Loesing.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>I was invited to speak on a panel at Sida about security, tools, and how they can be used in the world. The panel was generally for Sida staff to let them learn, ask questions, and interact with us in an informal way. A big thanks to Sida for providing the space and infrastructure support to allow us to all congeal for a day. My presentation from the panel is available[8].</p>\n<p>Despite not being invited last year, I was invited to the Stockholm Internet Forum[1] (SIF14) this year to help talk about Tor, privacy, a cyber-panopticon[2] panel, empowering women and tech, and generally meeting with various organizations about funding partnerships. I spent most of my time split between talking to various orgs about partnerships and hanging out with the cool dfri[3] people. I met Hillevi Engström[7] and introduced her and her attending staff to Tor. The cyper-panopticon panel was held during the unconference sessions on the first day. We generally raised topics of surveillance, chilling effects, encryption, and the nature of abusive relationships between some governments and their populaces. Some pictures and videos are available[4]--if anyone has more pictures or video, let me know via email. The panel wasn't officially recorded by SIF14.</p>\n<p>The better parts of the panels were the hallway/mingle sessions where everyone got to talk about real topics. I talked at length about the situation in Burkina Faso[5], the Uganda and LGBT situation, and spoke to a few women from Jordan, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Algiers, Morocco, Uganda, and Kenya about the state of women's access to and education in technology, especially in writing code to gain employment. Everyone wants to help equalize the situation for women in both economic and rights in these countries. A huge debt of gratitude to Sarah Cortes[6], a volunteer, researcher, and strong feminist for paying her own way to Sweden to represent Tor at Sida and at SIF14, explaining the details to most of the women at the conference, and for introducing Tor to a huge number of organizations in a very positive way. It's unfortunate the conference was dominated by discussions about a few white men and surveillance. Learning more about surveillance, Snowden, and women whistle-blowers would have been interesting. However, more time given to the topics of gender equality such as the \"crime of being a woman online\" and what we can do to empower all women with access,  opportunity, education, and increased technical skills would have been more interesting at a conference composed of 50% women. What have you done to fight the patriarchy today?</p>\n<p>I met and spoke with a few senior officials of the Middle East-North Africa region from the Foreign Ministry of Sweden about Tor, privacy, and supporting women in the region.</p>\n<p>I spent the rest of the week meeting with some people from potential partners, dfri, and other activists from around the world. The general feedback from potential funding organizations is that we have a lot of work to do and the rest of the world is quickly catching up and surpassing our capabilities. At the same time, there is a lot of interest in partnering with us to accomplish many goals in improving privacy, censorship circumvention research, and improving the situation of women online.</p>\n<p>All in all, a successful trip and great time in Sweden.</p>\n<p>1. <a href=\"http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/\" title=\"http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.stockholminternetforum.se/</a><br />\n2. <a href=\"https://cyberpanopticonsif.wordpress.com/\" title=\"https://cyberpanopticonsif.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://cyberpanopticonsif.wordpress.com/</a><br />\n3. <a href=\"https://www.dfri.se/\" title=\"https://www.dfri.se/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.dfri.se/</a><br />\n4. <a href=\"http://andrewlewman.smugmug.com/SIF14-Panopticon-Panel/\" title=\"http://andrewlewman.smugmug.com/SIF14-Panopticon-Panel/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://andrewlewman.smugmug.com/SIF14-Panopticon-Panel/</a><br />\n5. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso</a><br />\n6. <a href=\"http://sarahcortes.is/\" title=\"http://sarahcortes.is/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sarahcortes.is/</a><br />\n7. <a href=\"http://www.government.se/sb/d/13510\" title=\"http://www.government.se/sb/d/13510\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.government.se/sb/d/13510</a><br />\n8. <a href=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2014-05-26-Sida-Presentation.pdf\" title=\"https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2014-05-26-Sida-Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/presentations/2014-05-26-Sida-Pr...</a></p>\n<p>Originally sent to the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-May/000538.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tor-reports</a> mailing list.</p>"

Meanwhile, Debian has released a new stable version dubbed <a href=\"https://www.debian.org/releases/wheezy/\">Wheezy</a>, and the upcoming Tails 1.1 will be the first release to be based on the latter.</p>\n<p>The general set of features should not change much from the previous Tails release, but almost every software component has been updated. On<br />\nMay 30th, the Tails team <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/test_1.1-beta1/\">released a beta image</a>; given the number of changes, testing is even more welcome than usual.</p>\n<p>Testers can also try out the new UEFI support, which enables Tails to boot on recent hardware and on Macs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/test_1.1-beta1/#index3h1\">Several issues</a> with the current beta image have already been identified, so be sure to have a look at the list before <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/bug_reporting/\">reporting</a>.</p>\n<p>The details of the release schedule are <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-May/005917.html\">still being discussed</a> at the time of writing, but Tails 1.1 is likely to be out by the end of July. Please help make it a great release!</p>\n<h1>Stem 1.2 brings interactive interaction with the Tor daemon</h1>\n<p>On June 1st, Damian Johnson <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/stem-release-12\">announced</a> the release of <a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/\">Stem</a> 1.2. Stem is a Python library for interacting with the Tor daemon. It is now used by <a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/tutorials/double_double_toil_and_trouble.html\">several applications</a> like the <a href=\"https://www.atagar.com/arm/\">arm</a> status monitor and Philipp Winter’s <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/\">exit scanner</a>.</p>\n<p>The new version brings an interactive control interpreter, “a new method for interacting with Tor’s control interface that combines an interactive python interpreter with raw access similar to telnet”. This should make Tor hackers happy by saving them from having to manually poke the control port through telnet or create complete Stem scripts.</p>\n<p>For the complete list of changes, head over to the <a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/change_log.html#version-1-2\">changelog</a>.</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for May 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of May has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-May/000539.html\">Pearl Crescent</a> released their report first, followed by <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-May/000540.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000542.html\">Damian Johnson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000543.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000544.html\">Colin C.</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000545.html\">Georg Koppen</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000546.html\">Lunar</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000548.html\">Arlo Breault</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000550.html\">Matt Pagan</a>.</p>\n<p>Lunar also reported on behalf of the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000541.html\">help desk</a>, while Arturo Filastò did likewise for the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000547.html\">OONI team</a>, and Mike Perry for the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000549.html\">Tor Browser team</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Pups, a chat system implemented by Sherief Alaa for real-time invitation-based user support, has <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11657\">gone live</a>, and can now be used by Tor’s support assistants when that method promises a quicker resolution of an issue.</p>\n<p>In response to a question about the writing of unit tests for tor, Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006933.html\">shared</a> a brief guide to identifying lines in tor’s codebase that have not yet been covered by tests.</p>\n<p>Nick also put out a call (<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-May/004617.html\">relayed</a> by Moritz Bartl) for Tor relay operators running version 0.2.5.4-alpha or later to profile their relays, in order to identify potential bottlenecks.

Often these users will not need to configure anything, and clicking “Connect” is all that is necessary. Discussion on this problem is taking place on the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/12164\">bug tracker</a>.</p>\n<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/\">bridge distributor BridgeDB</a> populates its database from the cached descriptor files copied over from the bridge authority. There’s a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11216\">small bug</a> in BridgeDB where a line that is included in two different cached descriptor files gets added twice to the database. The ticket says this bug is easily reproducible and even contains commands for reproducing it. If you enjoy digging into unknown Python/Twisted codebases to find the few spots that need fixing, this bug may be for you. Be sure to comment on the ticket when you have a fix!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by harmony, Lunar, Matt Pagan and Karsten Loesing.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>This is a slightly belated announcement for the release of tor 0.2.4.22. Going into the future, we're planning to publish this information on the blog shortly after it is sent to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-announce\">tor-announce</a>.</p>\n<p>Release information is always published first on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk\">tor-talk</a>.</p>\n<p>Tor 0.2.4.22 backports numerous high-priority fixes from the Tor 0.2.5 alpha release series. These include blocking all authority signing keys that may have been affected by the OpenSSL \"heartbleed\" bug, choosing a far more secure set of TLS ciphersuites by default, closing a couple of memory leaks that could be used to run a target relay out of RAM, and several others.</p>\n<p>Here is the complete changelog:<br><br />\nChanges in version 0.2.4.22 - 2014-05-16: </p>\n<ul>\n<li> Major features (security, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):\n<ul>\n<li>Block authority signing keys that were used on authorities<br />\n      vulnerable to the \"heartbleed\" bug in OpenSSL (CVE-2014-0160). (We<br />\n      don't have any evidence that these keys _were_ compromised; we're<br />\n      doing this to be prudent.) Resolves ticket 11464.\n </ul>\n<li> Major bugfixes (security, OOM):\n<ul>\n<li>Fix a memory leak that could occur if a microdescriptor parse<br />\n      fails during the tokenizing step. This bug could enable a memory<br />\n      exhaustion attack by directory servers. Fixes bug 11649; bugfix<br />\n      on 0.2.2.6-alpha.\n </ul>\n<li> Major bugfixes (TLS cipher selection, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):\n<ul>\n<li> The relay ciphersuite list is now generated automatically based on<br />\n      uniform criteria, and includes all OpenSSL ciphersuites with<br />\n      acceptable strength and forward secrecy. Previously, we had left<br />\n      some perfectly fine ciphersuites unsupported due to omission or<br />\n      typo. Resolves bugs 11513, 11492, 11498, 11499. Bugs reported by<br />\n      'cypherpunks'. Bugfix on 0.2.4.8-alpha.</p>\n<li> Relays now trust themselves to have a better view than clients of<br />\n      which TLS ciphersuites are better than others. (Thanks to bug<br />\n      11513, the relay list is now well-considered, whereas the client<br />\n      list has been chosen mainly for anti-fingerprinting purposes.)<br />\n      Relays prefer: AES over 3DES; then ECDHE over DHE; then GCM over<br />\n      CBC; then SHA384 over SHA256 over SHA1; and last, AES256 over<br />\n      AES128. Resolves ticket 11528.</p>\n<li>Clients now try to advertise the same list of ciphersuites as<br />\n      Firefox 28. This change enables selection of (fast) GCM<br />\n      ciphersuites, disables some strange old ciphers, and stops<br />\n      advertising the ECDH (not to be confused with ECDHE) ciphersuites.<br />\n      Resolves ticket 11438.\n </ul>\n<li>  Minor bugfixes (configuration, security):\n<ul>\n<li> When running a hidden service, do not allow TunneledDirConns 0:<br />\n      trying to set that option together with a hidden service would<br />\n      otherwise prevent the hidden service from running, and also make<br />\n      it publish its descriptors directly over HTTP. Fixes bug 10849;<br />\n      bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha.\n </ul>\n<li> Minor bugfixes (controller, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):\n<ul>\n<li> Avoid sending a garbage value to the controller when a circuit is<br />\n      cannibalized. Fixes bug 11519; bugfix on 0.2.3.11-alpha.\n </ul>\n<li> Minor bugfixes (exit relay, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):\n<ul>\n<li> Stop leaking memory when we successfully resolve a PTR record.<br />\n      Fixes bug 11437; bugfix on 0.2.4.7-alpha.\n </ul>\n<li> Minor bugfixes (bridge client, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):\n<ul>\n<li> Avoid 60-second delays in the bootstrapping process when Tor is<br />\n      launching for a second time while using bridges. Fixes bug 9229;<br />\n      bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.\n </ul>\n<li> Minor bugfixes (relays and bridges, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):\n<ul>\n<li> Give the correct URL in the warning message when trying to run a<br />\n      relay on an ancient version of Windows. Fixes bug 9393.\n </ul>\n<li> Minor bugfixes (compilation):\n<ul>\n<li> Fix a compilation error when compiling with --disable-curve25519.<br />\n      Fixes bug 9700; bugfix on 0.2.4.17-rc.\n </ul>\n<li> Minor bugfixes:\n<ul>\n<li> Downgrade the warning severity for the the \"md was still<br />\n      referenced 1 node(s)\" warning. Tor 0.2.5.4-alpha has better code<br />\n      for trying to diagnose this bug, and the current warning in<br />\n      earlier versions of tor achieves nothing useful. Addresses warning<br />\n      from bug 7164.\n </ul>\n<li> Minor features (log verbosity, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):\n<ul>\n<li> When we run out of usable circuit IDs on a channel, log only one<br />\n      warning for the whole channel, and describe how many circuits<br />\n      there were on the channel. Fixes part of ticket 11553.\n </ul>\n<li> Minor features (security, backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):\n<ul>\n<li> Decrease the lower limit of MaxMemInCellQueues to 256 MBytes (but<br />\n      leave the default at 8GBytes), to better support Raspberry Pi<br />\n      users. Fixes bug 9686; bugfix on 0.2.4.14-alpha.\n </ul>\n<li> Documentation (backport from 0.2.5.4-alpha):\n<ul>\n<li> Correctly document that we search for a system torrc file before<br />\n      looking in ~/.torrc. Fixes documentation side of 9213; bugfix on<br />\n      0.2.3.18-rc.\n </ul>\n</ul>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the twenty-third issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser 3.6.2 is out</h1>\n<p>Version 3.6.2 of the Tor Browser has been <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-362-released\">released</a>, featuring “a fix to allow the configuration of a local HTTP or SOCKS proxy with all included Pluggable Transports”, as well as important fixes to mitigate recent OpenSSL vulnerabilities, among other security updates. All users are advised to <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html\">upgrade</a> as soon as possible.</p>\n<h1>The EFF announces its 2014 Tor Challenge</h1>\n<p>As part of the wider <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/reset-net\">“Reset the Net” event</a>, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-challenge-2014\">launched</a> another in its occasional series of Tor Challenges. The goal of the campaign is to increase the Tor network’s capacity and diversity by encouraging members of the public to run relays, and directing them to the legal and technical guidance necessary to do so.</p>\n<p>So far, over 600 relays have been started (or had their capacity increased) as part of the campaign: you can see a running total of relays and bytes transferred on the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/torchallenge/\">campaign page</a>. Once you’ve set up your relay, you can register it on the page (anonymously or credited to your name); stickers and T-shirts are on offer for those who run relays of a certain size or for a certain period.</p>\n<p>If you run into trouble setting up your relay, you can also find expert advice and discussion on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-relays\">tor-relays mailing list</a> or the #tor channel on irc.oftc.net.</p>\n<h1>Tor and the “EarlyCCS” bug</h1>\n<p>Following April’s much-loved “Heartbleed” bug, another OpenSSL vulnerability was discovered — nicknamed <a href=\"http://ccsinjection.lepidum.co.jp/\">“EarlyCCS”</a> — that could have an impact on the security of many internet services, including Tor. Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033161.html\">explained</a> that although “Tor is comparatively resilient to having one layer of crypto removed”, it may be affected to the extent that “an adversary in the position to run a MITM attack on a Tor client or relay could cause a TLS connection to be negotiated without real encryption or authentication.”</p>\n<p>Tor users and relay operators should make sure to update their OpenSSL and Tor packages as soon as possible; those using a system tor (rather than or in addition to the Tor Browser) should ensure that they restart it once the updates are installed; otherwise they will not take effect.</p>\n<h1>A new website for the directory archive</h1>\n<p>Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006942.html\">announced</a> the new <a href=\"https://collector.torproject.org/\">CollecTor service</a>, which spins off the directory archive section from the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/\">Metrics</a> portal.</p>\n<p>What’s different? Archive tarballs are now provided in a <a href=\"https://collector.torproject.org/archive/\">directory structure</a> rather than a single directory, recently published descriptors can now be accessed <a href=\"https://collector.torproject.org/recent/\">much more easily</a>, and the <a href=\"https://collector.torproject.org/formats.html\">documentation of descriptor formats</a> has been updated.</p>\n<p>The now obsolete rsync access to metrics-archive and metrics-recent will be discontinued on August 4, 2014.</p>\n<h1>More monthly status reports for May 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of May continued, with reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000551.html\">Karsten Loesing</a>, Isis Lovecruft (who submitted reports for both <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000553.html\">April</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000552.html\">May</a>), <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000554.html\">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000556.html\">Nicolas Vigier</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000559.html\">Roger Dingledine</a>.</p>\n<p>Roger also sent the report for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000558.html\">SponsorF</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>The Tails developers formally <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/Join_us_at_the_Tails_HackFest_2014/\">announced</a> the upcoming Tails Hackfest, inviting absolutely “anyone interested in making Tails more usable and more secure” to join them in Paris on the 5th and 6th of July (immediately after the Tor dev meeting) and “learn about the challenges faced by Tails, and how you can be part of the solution”. Fuller details of the venue and timetable can be found on the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/HackFest_2014_Paris/\">Tails website</a>.</p>\n<p>Several of Tor’s Google Summer of Code students submitted their regular progress reports: Juha Nurmi on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000555.html\">ahmia.fi project</a>, Israel Leiva on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006959.html\">GetTor revamp</a>, Amogh Pradeep on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006960.html\">Orbot+Orfox project</a>, Quinn Jarrell on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006961.html\">pluggable transport combiner</a>, Marc Juarez on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000557.html\">link-padding pluggable transport development</a>, Noah Rahman on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006962.html\">Stegotorus refactoring work</a>, Sreenatha Bhatlapenumarthi on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006964.html\">Tor Weather rewrite</a>, Daniel Martí on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006966.html\">implementation of consensus diffs</a>, and Mikhail Belous on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006984.html\">multicore tor daemon</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-June/000612.html\">moparisthebest</a> for running a mirror of the Tor Project website!</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-June/004642.html\">asked</a> the tor-relays mailing list about the situation of Mac OS X users who would like to run Tor relays, and what steps should be taken to make it easier for them to do so “now that the Vidalia bundles are deprecated and hard to find”.</p>\n<p>Isis Lovecruft has deployed <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git/blob_plain/cb8b01bc:/CHANGELOG\">BridgeDB version 0.2.2</a> which contains many fixes and translation updates.

    "content": "<p>Hello friends,</p>\n<p>this is a brief post on recent and upcoming developments of the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en\">Pluggable Transport</a> world:</p>\n<h1>What has happened</h1>\n<p>Here is what has been keeping us busy during the past few months:  </p>\n<h2>TBB 3.6</h2>\n<p>As many of you know, the TBB team recently released the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en\">Tor Browser Bundle 3.6</a> that features built-in PT support. This is great and has taken PT usage to <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=userstats-bridge-transport&amp;start=2014-03-17&amp;end=2014-06-15&amp;transport=obfs3#userstats-bridge-transport\">new levels</a>. Maaad props to the TBB team for all their work.</p>\n<p>TBB-3.6 includes obfs3 and FTE by default. If the built-in bridges are blocked for you (this is the case at least in China), try getting some more bridges from <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org\">BridgeDB</a> (which also got renovated recently).</p>\n<h2>obfs2 deprecation</h2>\n<p>We are in the process of <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10314\">deprecating</a> the obfs2 pluggable transport.</p>\n<p>This is because China blocks it using active probing, and because obfs3 is stictly better than obfs2. obfs3 can also be blocked using active probing, but China hasn't implemented this yet (at least as far as we know). The new upcoming line of PTs (like scramblesuit and obfs4) should be able to defend more effectively against active probing. </p>\n<h2>Outgoing proxies and Pluggable Transports</h2>\n<p>Yawning Angel et al. recently implemented <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/232-pluggable-transports-through-proxy.txt\">outgoing proxy support for PTs</a>. This means that soon our PTs will be able to connect to an outgoing proxy using the Socks5Proxy torrc option (or the corresponding proxy field in TBB).</p>\n<h2>A Childs Garden Of Pluggable Transports</h2>\n<p>David Fifield created <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/AChildsGardenOfPluggableTransports\">refreshing visualizations of Pluggable Transports</a>. Take a look; it might help you understand what these damned things are doing.</p>\n<h1>What will happen</h1>\n<p>Now let's take a look into the short-term future (a few months ahead) of Pluggable Transports:</p>\n<h2>obfs4 and ScrambleSuit</h2>\n<p>Remember <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-February/003886.html\">ScrambleSuit</a>? Guess what; we are thinking of <b>not</b> deploying it after all...</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong, ScrambleSuit is great, but during the past two months Yawning has been developing a new transport called <a href=\"https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4\">'obfs4'</a>. obfs4 is like ScrambleSuit (with regards to features and threat model), but it's faster and autofixes some of the open issues with scramblesuit (<a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10887\">#10887</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11271\">#11271</a>, ...).</p>\n<p>Since scramblesuit has not been entirely deployed yet, we thought that it would be a good idea to deploy obfs4 instead, and keep scramblesuit around as an emergency PT.</p>\n<h2>Meek</h2>\n<p>Meek is an exciting new transport by David Fifield. You can read all about it here: <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\" title=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek</a></p>\n<p>It's basically a transport that (ab)uses Firefox to do SSL in a way that makes it look like Firefox but underneath it's actually Tor. Very sneaky, and because it uses third-party services (like Google Appspot, Akamai, etc.) as proxies, the user does not need to input a bridge. Meek just works bridgeless and automagically.</p>\n<p>Help us by testing the latest bundles that David made: <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-June/000422.html\" title=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-June/000422.html\">https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-June/000422.html</a></p>\n<p>Also, since the <a href=\"https://en.greatfire.org/blog/2014/jun/google-disrupted-prior-tiananmen-anniversary-mirror-sites-enable-uncensored-access\">recent Google block in China</a>, Meek will not work with Google Appspot. However, other third-party services can be used instead of Appspot, so Meek does not lose its effectiveness.</p>\n<h2>PTs and IPv6</h2>\n<p>PTs are not very good at IPv6 yet. We identified some of <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12138\">the</a> <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11211\">open</a> <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7961\">issues</a> and hopefully we will fix them too.</p>\n<hr><br></p>\n<p>And that's that for now.</p>\n<p>Till next time, enjoy life and give thanks and praises :)</p>\n<p>(For what it's worth, this was originally a post in the [tor-talk] mailing list:<br />\n<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033296.html\" title=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033296.html\">https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033296.html</a>)</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the fiftieth issue of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tails 1.0.1 is out</h1>\n<p>The Tails developers <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.0.1/\">announced</a> the first point release in the Tails 1.0 series, following their <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-May/005917.html\">decision</a> to postpone the release of Tails 1.1 (which will be based on Wheezy, the latest stable version of Debian).</p>\n<p>This release contains no major new features, but does fix <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_1.0/index\">numerous security issues</a> present in 1.0, so all Tails users should upgrade as soon as possible.</p>\n<h1>Collecting statistics from Tor exits in a privacy-sensitive manner</h1>\n<p>Optimizing the Tor network to better support the most common use-cases could make a real difference to its perceived usability. Unfortunately, Tor is an anonymity network. Understanding what the most common use-cases are, in a way that does not endanger its users, is far from being a trivial problem.</p>\n<p>There have been some cases of <a href=\"http://www.ifca.ai/pub/fc11/wecsr11/soghoian.pdf\">inconsiderate spying on Tor network users</a> in the past. This is one of the motivations for the Tor Project to provide and research properly anonymized statistics through the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/\">Metrics</a> and <a href=\"https://collector.torproject.org/\">CollecTor</a> portals.</p>\n<p>Tariq Elahi, George Danezis, and Ian Goldberg are working on new solutions to tackle the problem of collecting statistics from Tor exits in a privacy-sensitive manner. Tariq <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006999.html\">announced</a> the PrivEx system which “preserves the security and privacy properties of anonymous communication networks, even in the face of adversaries that can compromise data collection nodes or coerce operators to reveal cryptographic secrets and keys”.</p>\n<p>The introduction of the <a href=\"http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2014/cacr2014-08.pdf\">detailed tech report</a> gives a general description of the solution: “PrivEx collects aggregated statistics to provide insights about user behaviour trends by recording aggregate usage of the anonymity network. To further reduce the risk of inadvertent disclosures, it collects only information about destinations that appear in a list of known censored websites. The aggregate statistics are themselves collected and collated in a privacy-friendly manner using secure multiparty computation primitives, enhanced and tuned to resist a variety of compulsion attacks and compromises. Finally, the granularity of the statistics is reduced […] to foil correlation attacks.”</p>\n<p>PrivEx’s threat model is described in section 3, and matches the current mode of operation of the Tor network, relying on a set of mostly honest collectors while being able to cope with a limited number of malicious nodes. Two variants are described: one “is secure in the honest-but-curious setting but can be disrupted by a misbehaving actor” while “the other is secure in the covert adversary setting in that misbehaving servers can be identified”, but is more computationally expensive.</p>\n<p>Tariq mentions that implementations of the two variants of PrivEx described in the tech report have been created and should soon be released to the community. The researchers expect to “start by rolling out our own PrivEx-enabled exits in the Tor network and begin collecting destination visit statistics” around the “June-August timeframe”. Section 6 contains an analysis of the overhead in both CPU and bandwidth of the two PrivEx variants, and the requirements seem reasonable.</p>\n<p>Given how much privacy matters to the Tor community and to all network users, the researchers wants “a measure of confidence that collecting data with PrivEx is inherently good and is being done in a responsible and intelligent manner”. They are therefore asking the “community at large” to review the design of the proposal, and its implementation once released.</p>\n<p>If no fundamental flaws are discovered in the process, the Tor community might finally be able to enjoy better network statistics in the not-too-distant future.</p>\n<h1>Upcoming developments in pluggable transports</h1>\n<p>In a new <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/recent-and-upcoming-developments-pluggable-transports\">blog post</a>, George Kadianakis reported on some recent pluggable transports developments. Some — like the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-36-released\">release of Tor Browser 3.6</a>, the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10314\">deprecation of obfs2</a>, the new <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek transport</a>, or the recently-written <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/AChildsGardenOfPluggableTransports\">“Child’s Garden Of Pluggable Transports” guide</a> should already be known to regular readers of Tor Weekly News.</p>\n<p>It was previously <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/232-pluggable-transports-through-proxy.txt\">impossible to use pluggable transports at the same time as an HTTP or SOCKS proxy</a>. The <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-362-released\">release of Tor Browser 3.6.2</a>is the first to include work by Yawning Angel which solves this deficiency.</p>\n<p>However, ScrambleSuit, released last winter, has not yet been included in Tor Browser. The pluggable transport team is considering skipping its deployment in favor of a new protocol, dubbed <a href=\"https://github.com/Yawning/obfs4\">obfs4</a>, which is “like ScrambleSuit (with regards to features and threat model), but it’s faster and autofixes some of the open issues”.</p>\n<p>George also mentions that enabling pluggable transports to work over IPv6 is on the team’s radar. As advanced deep packet inspection (DPI) on IPv6 is less common, it should buy some more time for users on censored networks.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>David Fifield <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033229.html\">updated</a> the <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/pt-bundle/3.6.2-meek-1/\">experimental Tor Browser builds that include the meek pluggable transport</a>. The new packages are based on Tor Browser version 3.6.2.</p>\n<p>meejah <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007006.html\">announced</a> a new release of txtorcon — a Twisted-based asynchronous Tor control protocol implementation. Version 0.10.0 adds support for Twisted’s endpoint strings. meejah explains: “this means that ANY Twisted program that uses endpoints can accept ‘onion:’ strings to bring up a hidden services easily […]. Typically, no code changes to the application should be needed […].”</p>\n<p>The Tails team <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2014_05/\">reported</a> progress on code, documentation, infrastructure, discussions, funding, and outreach matters for May. The report also mentions Tails’ position regarding the discontinuation of TrueCrypt.</p>\n<p>Following up on his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-December/005948.html\">earlier promise</a>, Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007007.html\">shut down</a> the Tor Metrics portal’s relay-search service, and in doing so reduced the size of the metrics database from 95 gigabytes to a mere 3. “If the metrics website shows you funny numbers in the next couple of days, please let me know”, wrote Karsten.</p>\n<p>Andrew Lewman <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000563.html\">reported</a> on his activities for May. Sebastian G. subsequently opened two discussions on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk\">tor-talk mailing list</a>: one regarding the challenges of <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033254.html\">integrating Tor into millions of products</a> and another on how <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033255.html\">US legislation is preventing the Tor Project, Inc. from receiving donations from certain countries</a>.</p>\n<p>Several GSoC students reported on the progress of their projects: Kostas Jakeliunas on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006988.html\">BridgeDB Twitter distributor</a>, Juha Nurmi for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000562.html\">ahmia.fi</a>, and Zack Mullaly on the <a href=\"https://lists.eff.org/pipermail/https-everywhere/2014-June/002128.html\">HTTPS Everywhere secure ruleset update mechanism</a>.</p>\n<p>Lukas Erlacher has released <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007018.html\">OnionPy 0.1.5</a>. “If you are planning to make something in python that uses the tor network status, accessing <a href=\"https://onionoo.torproject.org/\">Onionoo</a> using OnionPy might be exactly what you need”, Lukas wrote.</p>\n<p>The Tails developers <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/2014-June/001293.html\">suggested</a> that Tails translation teams using git, rather than the online Transifex platform, should begin signing their email pull requests with OpenPGP keys, to ensure that the process is not open to exploitation.</p>\n<p>Drupal.org, the main website for the development community around the free and open-source web platform Drupal, subscribes to a blacklist that includes Tor exit nodes, making it difficult for Tor users to interact with the site. AohRveTPV <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033250.html\">explained the problem</a>, and asked for “ideas on how to actually achieve better Drupal.org support for Tor users”.</p>\n<p>Chris Double <a href=\"http://bluishcoder.co.nz/2014/06/12/using-tor-with-firefox-os.html\">described</a> a detailed but experimental method for using Tor with Firefox OS, the mobile operating system from Mozilla. “This is just a proof of concept. Don’t depend on this […] Ideally Tor would be integrated with Firefox OS so that you can start and stop it as a service and maybe whitelist or blacklist sites that should and shouldn’t use Tor. I hope to do some of this over time or hope someone else gets excited enough to work on it too.”</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>The help desk has received some complaints regarding the default window size of the Tor Browser. To prevent window size fingerprinting, the browser window size has been set to a multiple of 100 pixels according to the detected screen resolution. Taskbars in the user workspace making selecting an appropriate window size slightly more complicated though; more details are available on the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9268\">bug’s ticket</a>.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>bk201 found some random-looking domain names in the logs of some network software. These connection attempts <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3324/88\">disappeared when Tor was closed</a>, so bk201 wants to know what they are. Lunar explained that they are requests for non-existent domain names. Tor wants to find out if some DNS servers send fake answers. This feature was <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/ReleaseNotes#l6663\">added in 2007</a>.</p>\n<p>user1747 often visits web sites which provide their services both within the visible web and as a hidden service (DuckDuckGo might serve as an example). <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3262/88\">Does the Tor Browser Bundle (TBB) automatically switch to a hidden service in this case?</a> mirimir explained that there is no connection between DNS and the names of hidden services, so TBB doesn’t know about this hidden service and can’t connect automatically. user2949 pointed to a <a href=\"https://github.com/chris-barry/darkweb-everywhere\">plugin</a>, similar to HTTPS Everywhere, that forwards a request to a hidden service if it is available.</p>\n<hr/>\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by harmony, Lunar, the Tails developers, Matt Pagan, Karsten Loesing, and qbi.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the twenty-fifth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the community around Tor, the “<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033358.html\">fine-meshed net</a>”.</p>\n<h1>Tor 0.2.5.5-alpha is out</h1>\n<p>Tor 0.2.5.5-alpha was <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033347.html\">released</a>, fixing “a wide variety of remaining issues in the Tor 0.2.5.x release series, including a couple of DoS issues, some performance regressions, a large number of bugs affecting the Linux seccomp2 sandbox code, and various other bugfixes”, in Nick Mathewson’s words. Among the major security improvements is an adjustment to the way Tor decides when to close TLS connections, which “should improve Tor’s resistance against some kinds of traffic analysis, and lower some overhead from needlessly closed connections”.</p>\n<p>You can download the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">source tarball</a>, or install the package by following the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/installguide\">instructions for your system</a>. This release is also now available in the <a href=\"http://packages.qa.debian.org/t/tor/news/20140619T120436Z.html\">Debian</a> and <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en#development\">Tor Project</a> repositories.</p>\n<h1>Debian Wheezy’s tor version to be updated</h1>\n<p>Following a <a href=\"https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=751977\">suggestion by Peter Palfrader</a>, Debian developers are preparing to update the version of tor found in the Debian stable repositories from 0.2.3.25 to 0.2.4.22. Among the chief motives for doing so is that “about a quarter of the Tor network (just considering the relays, not any clients), is on 0.2.3.25, presumably because they run Debian stable. If they all upgraded to the 0.2.4.x tree, the network as a whole would become a lot more secure as 0.2.4.x allows clients to use stronger crypto for connections built through these nodes.” Other benefits, including the various measures taken to defend against OpenSSL vulnerabilities discovered earlier this year, make this an attractive proposal.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://lists.debian.org/debian-changes/2014/06/msg00072.html\">update</a> will be shipped in the forthcoming point release (7.6) of Debian Wheezy, on July 12th.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Building on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-May/000414.html\">May release</a> of experimental Tor Browsers hardened with AddressSanitizer (ASan), Georg Koppen <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-June/000428.html\">announced</a> a new set of experimental Linux builds that include both AddressSanitizer and Undefined Behaviour Sanitizer (UBSan), asking for testing and feedback.  See Georg’s message for download and build instructions, as well as a couple of known issues.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033376.html\">reminded</a> Tor users, relay operators, and especially hidden service administrators that tor’s 0.2.2 series is no longer supported, and many features will soon stop working entirely; if you are affected, then please upgrade!</p>\n<p>Several of Tor’s Google Summer of Code students submitted their regular progress reports: Daniel Martí on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007030.html\">implementation of consensus diffs</a>, Mikhail Belous on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007034.html\">multicore tor daemon</a>, Juha Nurmi on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000564.html\">ahmia.fi project</a>, Zack Mullaly on the <a href=\"https://lists.eff.org/pipermail/https-everywhere/2014-June/002147.html\">HTTPS Everywhere secure ruleset update mechanism</a>, Amogh Pradeep on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007036.html\">Orbot+Orfox project</a>, Sreenatha Bhatlapenumarthi on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007037.html\">Tor Weather rewrite</a>, Marc Juarez on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000567.html\">link-padding pluggable transport development</a>, Israel Leiva on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007039.html\">GetTor revamp</a>, Quinn Jarrell on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007040.html\">pluggable transport combiner</a>, Kostas Jakeliunas on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007041.html\">BridgeDB Twitter Distributor</a>, and Noah Rahman on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007043.html\">Stegotorus security enhancement</a>.</p>\n<p>Researchers from the Internet Geographies project at the Oxford Internet Institute <a href=\"http://geography.oii.ox.ac.uk/?page=tor\">produced a cartogram</a> of Tor users by country, using archived data freely available from the Tor Project’s <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org\">own Metrics portal</a>, along with an analysis of the resulting image. “As ever more governments seek to control and censor online activities, users face a choice to either perform their connected activities in ways that adhere to official policies, or to use anonymity to bring about a freer and more open Internet”, they conclude.</p>\n<p>Andrew Lewman <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-June/004752.html\">reported</a> that users with email addresses at Yahoo and AOL have been removed from the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-relays\">tor-relays mailing list</a>, as these addresses have been bouncing list emails.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-June/000617.html\">FoDT.it webteam</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-June/000619.html\">Maxanoo</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project’s website!</p>\n<p>fr33tux <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033337.html\">shared</a> the <a href=\"http://fr33tux.org/data/prez.pdf\">slides</a> for a French-language presentation on Tor, delivered at Université de technologie Belfort-Montbéliard. The source code (in the LaTeX markup language) is <a href=\"http://git.fr33tux.org/conference_tor_utbm.git\">also available</a>: “feel free to borrow whatever you want from it!”</p>\n<p>Thanks to Ximin Luo, the server component of <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/\">Flashproxy</a> is now available in Debian in the <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/pt-websocket\">“pt-websocket” package</a>.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, Roger Dingledine wondered “how many relays are firewalling certain outbound ports (and thus messing with connectivity inside the Tor network)”. ra has just <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/12131#comment:11\">published the results</a> of a three-week-long test of the interconnectivity between 6730 relays.  Contacting the operators of problematic relays is probably the next step for those who wish to keep the network at its best.</p>\n<p>George Kadianakis slipped on his storyteller costume to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007042.html\">guide us</a> through layers of the Tor core, motivated by the quest for knowledge.  That accursed riddle, “Why does Roger have so many guards?”, now has an answer. Be prepared for a “beautiful stalagmite” and the “truly amazing” nature of Tor!</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>If the Tor Browser stalls while “loading the network status”, please double-check that the system clock is accurate; the same goes for the timezone and daylight saving time settings. Tor needs an accurate clock in order to prevent several classes of attacks on its protocol. It won’t work properly when the local time does not match the one used by other network participants.</p>\n<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>\n<p>When the tor daemon is configured to open a SOCKS port on a public address, it warns about this possible configuration problem twice: once when it reads the configuration file, and a second time when it opens the listener. One warning should be enough. We had a friendly volunteer two years ago who sketched out possible fixes and even wrote a patch, but then concluded that his patch had a problem and went away. If you’re up to some digging into tor’s configuration file handling, and want to clean up a two-year-old patch potentially to be included in tor 0.2.6, please <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/4019\">find the details in the ticket</a>. It’s tagged as easy, so how hard can it be?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by harmony, Lunar, Matt Pagan, Karsten Loesing, and Roger Dingledine.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN? Please help us create this newsletter. We still need more volunteers to watch the Tor community and report important news.

Since then, we have been able to provide you news about the Tor community every week (except one).</p>\n<p>Tor Weekly News is a community newsletter, so let’s all appreciate everyone who contributed so far: Andreas Jonsson, bastik, Colin, Damian Johnson, David Fifield, David Stainton, dope457, Georg Koppen, George Kadianakis, harmony, Jacob Appelbaum, Jesse Victors, Johannes Fürmann, Karsten Loesing, Kostas Jakeliūnas, Lunar, luttigdev, malaparte, Matt Pagan, Mike Perry, moskvax, murb, Nick Mathewson, Nicolas Vigier, nicoo, Nima, Paul Feitzinger, Peter Palfrader, Philipp Winter, Phoul, qbi, ra, rey, Roger Dingledine, Sandeep, sqrt2, the Tails developers, velope, whabib, Yawning, and several anonymous contributors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/news-team\">Join us</a>! The Tor community is always growing and there are always interesting topics to report about!</p>\n<h1>2014 Summer Tor meeting</h1>\n<p>Dedicated Tor contributors are having a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014SummerDevMeeting\">five day meeting</a> this week in Paris. Expect less online activity while keyboards are put away in favor of unmediated human interactions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~isis/2014-summer-tor-dev-meeting.postits.tar.xz\">Pictures of post-it-note-based brainstorming sessions</a> can already be seen online, and more minutes should be coming soon.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to several factors, there will be no widely open event around meeting this time.</p>\n<h1>Tails user experience experiments</h1>\n<p>Tails is experimenting on how to improve its user experience.</p>\n<p>u. <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-June/006200.html\">reported on the first Tails UX experiments session</a>. Five people attended, trying to realize three different missions: “create a new encrypted document of your choice […], and save it to Tails, using persistence”, “find out the number of Tails downloads this month, and pass on this information using GPG via email”, “find one or more images [… and] clean up these files to erase any metadata”.</p>\n<p>Some of what has been learned by watching users has already been converted into concrete bugs and enhancement proposals. For the rest, read the detailed and insightful report!</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the first dialog window that appears when using Tails — also known as “the greeter” — is being redesigned. A first round of test images is now <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-June/006194.html\">ready</a> for your feedback.</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for June 2014</h1>\n<p>While Kevin Dyer sent out his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000565.html\">report for May</a>, the wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of June has started. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000569.html\">Damian Johnson</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000570.html\">Pearl Crescent</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000572.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000573.html\">Karsten Loesing</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000574.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>.</p>\n<p>Lunar reported <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-July/000575.html\">on behalf of the help desk</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Lunar <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000568.html\">shared some highlights</a> on a trip to Calafou, near Barcelona, to attend <a href=\"http://backbone409.calafou.org/\">Backbone 409</a>, an event for “projects actively building infrastructures for a free Internet from an anti-capitalist point of view”. Topics under discussion included hosting websites in the face of legal threats; secure operating systems; and the logistics of running a Torservers.net partner organization.</p>\n<p>Juha Nurmi submitted a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-June/000571.html\">status report for the ahmia.fi Google Summer of Code project</a>.</p>\n<p>Nusenu <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-June/033463.html\">warned</a> users of the Tor Project’s RPM repository that an updated package available in the official Fedora repo will cause their tor to stop working, and set out two ways in which they can solve the problem.</p>\n<p>starlight <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-June/004821.html\">gave an account</a> of their experience running a tor relay using versions of OpenSSL and libevent that had been hardened with AddressSanitizer.</p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://fteproxy.org/\">fteproxy</a> pluggable transport has been integrated into the Tor Browser, documentation on how to setup bridges was lacking. A problem fixed by Colin who took the time to document <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/fte/setup\">how to setup FTE bridges</a>.</p>\n<p>George Kadianakis gave an <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-June/004823.html\">insightful answer</a> to Rick Huebneron’s questions about the status of the “UpdateBridgesFromAuthority” feature. The latter should allow bridge users to automatically update the IP address of their bridge when it changes. But the feature is currently turned off by default as several problems are currently preventing it to be useful. Have a look at George’s summary if you want to scratch that itch.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>The help desk has been asked about the “ethics” behind Tor. Tor’s technical design decisions are laid out in <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git\">the various design documents</a>, but to understand the social and cultural motivations for the Tor Project, videos like <a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/video/tor-internet-days-2010.mp4\">Roger’s talk at Internet Days</a>, or Jake and Roger’s talks at the Chaos Communications Congress <a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/video/28c3-4800-en-how_governments_have_tried_to_block_tor_h264.mp4\">in 2011</a> and <a href=\"https://media.torproject.org/video/30C3_-_5423_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201312272030_-_the_tor_network_-_jacob_-_arma_concat_.mp4\">2013</a> are good resources.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, harmony, Matt Pagan, and Rob Jansen.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

Tor's anonymity is based on distributed trust, so observing traffic at one place in the Tor network, even a directory authority, isn't enough to break it. Tor has gone mainstream in the past few years, and its wide diversity of users -- from civic-minded individuals and ordinary consumers to activists, law enforcement, and companies -- is part of its security. Just learning that somebody visited the Tor or Tails website doesn't tell you whether that person is a journalist source, someone concerned that her Internet Service Provider will learn about her health conditions, or just someone irked that cat videos are blocked in her location.</p>\n<p>Trying to make a list of Tor's millions of daily users certainly counts as widescale collection. Their attack on the bridge address distribution service shows their \"collect all the things\" mentality -- it's worth emphasizing that we designed bridges for users in countries like China and Iran, and here we are finding out about attacks by our own country. Does reading the contents of those mails violate the wiretap act? Now I understand how the Google engineers felt when they learned about the attacks on their infrastructure.</p>"

    "content": "<p>There has been a considerable amount of work in the area of Tor incentives since <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/two-incentive-designs-tor\">the last post on the topic in 2009</a> (over 5 years ago!). This post will give an overview of some of the major new approaches, including two new designs that I co-authored that will appear at <a href=\"https://www.petsymposium.org/2014/hotpets.php\">the Workshop on Hot Topics in Privacy Enhancing Technologies</a> later this week. Before getting to those, I'll give background on Tor and discuss some of the social issues to help form a foundation of understanding.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"volunteer_resources\" href=\"#volunteer_resources\">Tor’s volunteer resource model</a></h2>\n<p>The Tor network consists of a <a href=\"http://torstatus.blutmagie.de/\">set of relays</a> that provide bandwidth and other resources to forward traffic for Tor users. Anyone in any part of the world can contribute to Tor by downloading <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en\">the Tor software</a> and <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en\">configuring it to operate in relay mode</a>. In fact, the Tor network is currently composed exclusively of such voluntarily-operated relays.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons existing relay operators might contribute to Tor. They may contribute because they really want a privacy-enhancing communication tool like Tor to exist, they believe in Tor’s philosophy of open source software and operational transparency, and they want Tor to succeed at its goals. They may wish to be part of the Tor community and the social movement to provide privacy-enhanced communication that connects people in all parts of the world. Tor may be practically useful to them for communication with others or to retrieve content that may otherwise be unavailable to them due to censorship or other network interference. Or they may be technically interested in the Tor software or network and the associated research problems raised by large, distributed systems. Finally, some may be interested for adversarial reasons, e.g., collecting information on the uses of the network or the content being transferred. All of these reasons provide intrinsic motivation for operators to contribute - they don’t expect any direct compensation for their contributions.</p>\n<p>The volunteer approach has succeeded so far: Tor now consists of <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html#networksize\">over 5000 relays</a> transferring <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html#bandwidth\">between 4 and 5 GiB/s in aggregate</a>. For the most part, this is \"organic\" growth obtained through community outreach, where volunteers first have personal contact with existing community members and become inspired to help.</p>\n<p>Whatever their reason for volunteering, relay operators not only contribute resources from the physical machines upon which their relays are executed, but also contribute the time involved with configuring, updating, and adjusting their relays as both the software and network mature. In many cases, operators also contribute monetarily through the direct purchase of dedicated machines or special fast connections to Internet Service Providers (ISPs), and exit relay operators spend social energy on maintaining relationships with their ISP (to make sure the ISP understands that requests coming from their machines are from Tor).</p>\n<p>However, because many people that are otherwise excited about or interested in Tor are incapable or unwilling to incur these expenses, there are far fewer Tor relays than Tor clients (users that use Tor to access content, e.g. via the Tor Browser Bundle, without directly contributing resources to the network). Expanding the set of relays could have many benefits: Tor could become faster, more reliable, and more secure while at the same time distributing trust among a larger and more diverse set of distributed peers. A larger network that is transferring a larger quantity and more diverse types of data will, in general, make it more difficult for an adversary to determine who is talking to whom. This means a safer Tor for everyone.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"incentives_motivation\" href=\"#incentives_motivation\">Incentives and motivation... say whuuuht?</a></h2>\n<p>There are many social and technical challenges involved with expanding the set of Tor relays. We focus here on the social issues surrounding how to encourage more people to run a relay in the first place by providing incentives (i.e., rewards) for relay operators, and later focus on how to do this without leaking information or otherwise hurting Tor’s anonymity.</p>\n<p>An important social issue to consider is that of maintaining the existing community of operators and how rewards could harm it. The presumption here is that existing relay operators are motivated to run relays for their own reasons - the act of contributing to Tor itself has intrinsic value to them. Then the question is: what would happen if we start rewarding operators through the use of an incentive system?</p>\n<p>The answer isn’t clear, and there are at least a couple of forks in the cognitive road with many more questions along the way. First, what would happen to the existing operators who used to feel good about volunteering but are now compensated with a reward that may have extrinsic value? Although the new reward may provide some extrinsic value, will it lower their original intrinsic value enough to cause them to <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation\">lose their motivation</a> to contribute? Will they continue their contributions but begin to expect the reward, such that <a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/Intrinsic_vs._Extrinsic_Motivation#Why_Extrinsic_Motivation_Doesn.27t_Work\">if the reward is removed later they would no longer be motivated</a> even though originally (before the reward) they were happy to contribute? Second, is the new group of operators attracted to Tor by the reward somehow less desirable than the existing group, because they don’t care as much about Tor or are more likely to stop contributions and leave the system more quickly than the existing volunteers? Is the fact that they have higher extrinsic motivation than intrinsic make them better or worse operators? Will they be less likely to incur the costs of saying \"no\" when people ask them to log or turn over traffic? Will they in fact be willing to sell logs if it increases their rewards? Third, how will the new group of operators affect the existing group? If their intrinsic motivation was low enough before the reward that they didn’t contribute, but high enough with the reward that they do contribute, are these new contributors going to somehow shift the \"community spirit\" into something that no longer has the value that it once had? Will this <a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/Crowding_Out\">\"crowd out\" the intrinsically motivated individuals</a> and cause existing operators to leave (a <a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/Crowding_Out#Empirical_evidence_of_the_crowding_effect\">widely</a> <a href=\"http://www.roughtype.com/?p=479\">acknowledged</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation_crowding_theory\">theory</a>)?</p>\n<p>The answers to these questions are not clear, though speculations abound. One response is that we will never know what will happen until we try it, but if we try it we may not like the result. Another is that if we try it and it succeeds, great; if it starts going badly, we can adapt and adjust.</p>\n<p>Researchers and other Tor community members have been interested in the Tor incentive problem because a well-designed incentive scheme has the potential to greatly improve the network (we will discuss several technical designs below). However, because of the many open social questions, it has been challenging for the Tor community to come to a consensus on the path forward. On one hand and as discussed above, many people already run Tor relays and provide valuable service, and the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html#networksize\">network</a> and <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/network.html#bandwidth\">bandwidth</a> graphs imply some amount of success in network growth. It would be tragic if the introduction of an experimental reward scheme drove away the existing participants. On the other hand, the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html#userstats-relay-country\">number of Tor clients still vastly exceeds the number of relays</a>, and Tor’s bandwidth capacity remains the limiting factor for Tor’s growth. </p>\n<h2><a id=\"reasoning_model\" href=\"#reasoning_model\">A simplified model of reasoning</a></h2>\n<p>If we consider that relay operators with a higher intrinsic motivation to contribute are somehow more desirable to the network and the community because they care more deeply about Tor and the social movement, then we can consider there to be a trade-off between reward value and the desirability of the operator. The lower the extrinsic reward value is, the higher the intrinsic value a potential new operator must possess in order for the total value to be high enough to motivate her to contribute. The higher the extrinsic reward value is, the lower the intrinsic value may be to still attract the new operator. Under this model, as the value of the reward increases, the number of individuals willing to contribute also increases while their \"quality\" decreases.</p>\n<p>Please note that this is a very simplified model of reasoning and since it does not necessarily reflect reality, not everyone should agree with it. There are many other values in play here as well; for example, motivations change over time as the world changes, and incentive schemes that require significant protocol modifications are more difficult to implement, test, and deploy. Nonetheless, this simplified model may help sort out the issues, and it seems to be consistent with the fact that the Tor community has thus far preferred to grow the network through intrinsically motivated relay operators.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"social_rewards\" href=\"#social_rewards\">Social rewards</a></h2>\n<p>Tor’s volunteer approach has generally been on the conservative side of our simplified model, where individuals with higher intrinsic motivations to contribute to Tor are preferred. New operators have been recruited through social and community-oriented efforts such as explaining how great Tor is and why they should care. This works well for people who are already intrinsically motivated about Tor, such as <a href=\"http://imgur.com/sZUKADG\">this guy who tattooed a Tor onion on his arm</a>.</p>\n<p>Other relay recruitment approaches for intrinsically motivated individuals include <a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/\">Torservers.net</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Tor\">Noisebridge Tor Exit Node Project</a>: both operate as independent nonprofit organizations for those people who would like to contribute to the Tor network but for one reason or another are not in a position to operate relays themselves. As discussed in a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/support-tor-network-donate-exit-node-providers\">2011 post</a>, it is preferable that people who can run their own fast exit relays do so. But the approach of turning donations into fast exit capacity allows those who cannot run their own relays to still contribute to improving the performance and exit capacity of the Tor network.</p>\n<p>The more recent <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/torchallenge/\">EFF Tor Challenge</a> is somewhere on the same side of the spectrum, except it actually offers small rewards as incentives. EFF explains Tor’s importance and users are encouraged to contribute to the network by running a relay. The challenge offers prizes to relay operators as an incentive: name and twitter handle published in a list of contributors, a limited edition sticker for running a relay for 12 months, and a t-shirt if that relay is fast (bandwidth of 1 MB/s or larger after 12 months).</p>\n<p>Other social rewards are possible here as well. A <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/006975.html\">post on the tor-dev mailing list</a> proposes that Tor host a simple profile page for each relay that will list and celebrate the relay’s total bandwidth contribution over time, and recognize the operator for running special Tor bridge or exit relays. Relatively simple ideas like this may have the potential to attract intrinsically-motivated individuals without requiring extrinsic rewards or a lot of changes to Tor itself.</p>\n<p>The approaches in this category are relatively low-risk/low-reward schemes: even though the new operators are receiving recognition or a reward for running a relay, the reward is of such little value that there is little risk that existing contributors who may not have been rewarded will leave. At the same time, a new operator loses little if it decides to shut down the new relay.</p>\n<p>On the other side of the spectrum are more \"radical\" approaches that do not require individuals with high intrinsic motivation (though they are welcome, too!) but change Tor’s design have been explored by researchers. Researchers explore these designs because they are generally more technically interesting and have the potential to produce a much larger set of relays. We now shift to discussing these latest research proposals.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"research_review\" href=\"#research_review\">Review of early research on Tor incentive system designs - Gold Star and PAR</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/two-incentive-designs-tor\">The 2009 post</a> discussed two incentive papers that were new at the time: <a href=\"http://cs.gmu.edu/~astavrou/research/Par_PET_2008.pdf\">Payment for Anonymous Routing</a> from PETS 2008 (PAR) and <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/incentives-fc10.pdf\">Building Incentives into Tor</a> from FC 2010 (the \"Gold Star\" scheme).</p>\n<p>In the Gold Star scheme, the Tor directory authorities measure the bandwidth of Tor relays and assign a special flag (a \"gold star\") to the fastest 7/8 of relays. Then whenever those relays send traffic through Tor, they choose the other fast gold star relays to form a fast gold star path. Relays then prioritize traffic on these gold star paths. The incentive here is that if you run a relay, you will get faster service when using Tor as a client. The main drawback to this approach is that only relays are able to get gold stars and priority service. This means that all relays that are part of a gold star path know for certain that the initiator of that traffic is someone from the small list of gold star relays. Because the set of gold star relays would be smaller than the set of all Tor users by several orders of magnitude, the anonymity for gold star relays would be significantly harmed.</p>\n<p>In PAR, all users (not just relays) are able to be part of the incentive system. PAR has an honest-but-curious centralized entity called a \"bank\" that manages digital tokens called \"coins\". Users can purchase coins from the bank and then pay the relays while using Tor; the relays then deposit the coins back into the bank and the bank checks to make sure the coin is valid and that it has never been spent before (i.e., it has not been \"double spent\"). The main novel idea explored in this work is how to include digital payments into each Tor circuit in a way that prevents the relays from learning the client’s identity from the payment itself.</p>\n<p>Adding real money into Tor opens a host of new legal and technical questions, which <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/two-incentive-designs-tor\">Roger already briefly discussed</a>. For example, real money might shift Tor into a different legal category (see e.g. the EU discussions of what is a \"service provider\" and which ones are obliged to do data retention), or change the liability situation for relay operators.</p>\n<p>The main design challenge we learned from the PAR design is that the timing of when the client withdraws the coins and the relays deposit them creates a trade-off between the ability to detect double spending and link a client to its coins. If the client withdraws some coins and a few seconds later a relay starts depositing coins, how much information does the bank gain? If the relay waits for some time interval to deposit the coins to hide this timing information, then it becomes possible for the client to double spend those coins during that interval. The longer the relay waits before depositing, the harder it is for the bank to link the coins but the easier it is for the client to cheat. A rational relay will deposit immediately to secure its payment, which leads to the worst situation for anonymity. If we assume the relays will deposit immediately, then it is up to the client to hold coins for some random amount of time after purchasing them from the bank, to disrupt potential attempts to link withdrawals to deposits at the cost of flexibility in usage.</p>\n<p>In review, both of these proposals have anonymity problems: the Gold Star scheme because the assignment of rewards to relays is public and identifies traffic as originating from the relatively small set of clients of fast relay operators; and PAR because the timing of the withdrawal by the client and the deposit by the relay may leak information about the client’s traﬃc. In PAR, coins may be held by the client and the relay longer to disrupt this timing information, but this trades off flexibility in usage and the speed at which double spending can be detected. So what have these papers taught us? We have learned about some requirements that a Tor incentive scheme should probably fulfill: both clients and relays should be able to receive the incentive so that neither group stands out; and the timing of payments should not allow cheating and should not enable linkability. </p>\n<h2><a id=\"prevent_doublespend_timing\" href=\"#prevent_doublespend_timing\">Preventing double-spending without leaking timing information - BRAIDS</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.robgjansen.com/publications/braids-ccs2010.pdf\">Recruiting New Tor Relays with BRAIDS</a> was the followup research proposal presented at CCS in 2010. One of our goals in BRAIDS was to eliminate the trade-off between double-spending and linkability. To achieve this, we designed a new type of digital token which we called a \"relay-specific ticket\". Tickets were still issued by a trusted, centralized entity - the ticketmaster (we called it a \"bank\" in the paper, but BRAIDS was not designed to handle real money). Clients choose which relays they want to use, and receive tickets from the ticketmaster that are valid only at the chosen relays while hiding the chosen relay information from the ticketmaster (using partially-blind signatures). Clients then form a Tor circuit with the chosen relays and send the tickets to receive traffic priority (using a differentiated services scheduler). Each ticket will then provide traffic priority through the chosen relay for a specific number of bytes. Because each ticket a relay receives is only valid at that relay and no other, the relay could prevent double spending locally without contacting the ticketmaster.</p>\n<p>Another feature of BRAIDS is that tickets are distributed freely in small amount to any client that asks, but only to one client per IP address, and only once per distribution round. If the clients change their mind about which relays they want to use for a circuit, they may contact the ticketmaster to exchange their old tickets for new ones following a time schedule. The exchange process is also used by relays to turn the tickets they received from clients into new usable tickets.</p>\n<p>One main drawback to BRAIDS is that even though all users are able to get a small amount of tickets for free, relays are able to accumulate a much larger stash because they receive the free tickets AND the tickets sent to them by other clients. This means that relays stand out when using tickets to download large flows because it is less likely that a normal client would have been able to afford it. Another major drawback is that the exchange process is somewhat inefficient. Relays will exchange received tickets for new ones which they can use themselves, and clients that didn't spend their tickets (e.g., because their Tor usage was low or their chosen relays became unavailable) must exchange them or lose them. This leads to the ticketmaster exchanging all system tickets over every exchange interval. (The ticket validity interval is split into [spend, relay exchange, client exchange], so clients that don't spend in the \"spend\" time-frame must wait until \"client exchange\" time-frame to get new tickets. Increasing the interval lengths make them slightly less flexible to rapid changes. The longer the intervals, the more tickets will \"pile up\" for later processing by the ticketmaster.)</p>\n<p>BRAIDS showed us the power of relay-specific tickets but unveiled the scalability problems associated with a trusted, centralized entity.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"improving_scalability\" href=\"#improving_scalability\">Improving scalability - LIRA</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.robgjansen.com/publications/lira-ndss2013.pdf\">LIRA: Lightweight Incentivized Routing for Anonymity</a> was published at NDSS 2013. LIRA still uses a centralized entity to manage the incentives, but LIRA only requires incentive management for the relays (thousands) instead of for all system users (millions) like BRAIDS. The way we achieve this is through the use of a lottery system, where clients could simply guess a random number for every circuit to receive priority on that circuit (traffic is prioritized using a differentiated services scheduler as in BRAIDS) with tunable probability. The lottery is set up with special <a href=\"http://mit.tv/wHGsAp\">cryptography magic</a> such that relays are rewarded with guaranteed winning guesses to the lottery; relays are allotted winners according to the amount of bandwidth they contributed.</p>\n<p>LIRA is more efficient and scalable than any earlier scheme. However, LIRA’s main drawback is that probabilistic guessing reduces flexibility for clients wanting to receive continuous priority over time, and creates a potential for cheating the system because it enables clients to continuously create new circuits and new guesses until a correct guess is found. Another problem is that a secure bandwidth measurement scheme is required to ensure that relays don’t receive rewards without actually contributing to Tor (this wasn't necessary in BRAIDS because the clients sent rewards (tickets) directly to the relays); secure bandwidth measurement is still an open research problem. Finally, LIRA still relies on a trusted central entity to manage the lottery.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"reducing_trust_requirements\" href=\"#reducing_trust_requirements\">Reducing reliance on trusted parties - TEARS</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.robgjansen.com/publications/tears-hotpets2014.pdf\">From Onions to Shallots: Rewarding Tor Relays with TEARS</a> will be presented at HotPETs later this week. The main goal in TEARS is to remove the reliance on a central entity to manage the incentives. The central entities in the above schemes (let’s generalize them as \"banks\") are referred to as \"semi-trusted\", because there are several ways a malicious bank could misbehave - for example, the bank could refuse service, could extort users by demanding extra fees in order to process their requests, or could \"inflate\" the digital currency (coins, tickets, guesses, etc.) by printing its own tokens for a profit.</p>\n<p>TEARS draws upon the decentralized Bitcoin design to address these concerns by using a <b>*publicly auditable*</b> e-cash protocol that prevents the bank from misbehaving and getting away with it. The bank in TEARS consists of a group of semi-trusted servers, such as the Tor directory servers (as opposed to Bitcoin’s distributed proof-of-work lottery), only a quorum of which need to function correctly for the overall system to keep working. The e-cash cryptography used here is publicly auditable and every interaction with the bank is conducted over a public communication channel (such as the Bitcoin blockchain itself). The security guarantee is that any form of misbehavior on the part of the bank servers leaves a trail of evidence that can be discovered by anyone watching. This approach is reminiscent of systems like <a href=\"http://www.certificate-transparency.org/\">Certificate Transparency</a> and <a href=\"http://opentransactions.org\">OpenTransactions.</a></p>\n<p>In addition to a decentralized bank, TEARS offers a new two-level token architecture to facilitate rewarding relays for their bandwidth contributions without hurting anonymity. First, a decentralized process audits relays’ bandwidth and informs the bank of the results. The bank mints new \"shallots\" (anonymous, auditable e-cash) for each relay based on their contributions and deposits them into the relay accounts on their behalf. Separately, the bank’s monetary policy may allow it to mint new shallots and distribute them to users, e.g. using mechanisms suggested in BRAIDS but more commonly known to Bitcoin users as <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bitcoin_faucet\">faucets</a>. Second, shallots are transferable among users and may be redeemed for relay-specific \"PriorityPasses\", which are then used to request traffic priority from Tor relays (again, as in BRAIDS). PriorityPasses are relay-specific so that relays can immediately and locally prevent double spending without leaking information to any other entity. This is a similar feature present in BRAIDS’ tickets. However, a novel feature of PriorityPasses is that they are non-transferable and become useless after being spent at a relay -- this reduces overhead associated with exchanges, and ensures that the process of requesting traffic priority does not harm anonymity because the act of redeeming a shallot for a PriorityPass will be unlinkable to any later transaction. There is a question of how many PriorityPasses can be spent in one circuit before it is suspicious that a client has so many, so the size of the faucets and how they distribute Shallots will play a key role in anonymity. Anonymity is also tied to how relays decide to distribute their Shallots to clients, either via a faucet or a through a third party market.</p>\n<p>TEARS was designed to operate inside the existing Tor network and thus does not significantly change the fundamentals of Tor’s design. The decentralized bank and bandwidth measurement components do not alter the way clients choose circuits. Clients and relays that want to use or support TEARS, however, would need to support new protocols for interacting with the bank and logic for handling shallots, PriorityPasses, and traffic priority.</p>\n<p>TEARS still relies on a \"bandwidth measuring\" component that can accurately and robustly determine when a relay has indeed contributed useful bandwidth. While the e-cash system in TEARS is designed to be publicly auditable, the existing mechanisms for bandwidth still require trusted authorities to probe. </p>\n<h2><a id=\"bandwidth_measurement\" href=\"#bandwidth_measurement\">Bandwidth measurement - TorCoin</a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.robgjansen.com/publications/torpath-hotpets2014.pdf\">A TorPath to TorCoin - Proof-of-Bandwidth Altcoins for Compensating Relays</a> is the other paper to be presented at HotPETs this week. TorCoin addresses the bandwidth measurement problem with a different approach -- an altcoin (a Bitcoin alternative) based on a novel \"proof-of-bandwidth\" (rather than proof-of-work) mechanism called TorPath, in which the relays (and endpoints) of a circuit effectively mine for new coins whenever they successfully transfer a batch of packets. In TorCoin, a group of \"assignment\" authorities are responsible for generating a list of circuits (using a shuffle protocol) and assigning them to clients. Bandwidth proofs are then constructed as the circuit is used such that the client mines the TorCoin and then transfers part of it to each of the circuit’s participants.</p>\n<p>Like TEARS, TorCoin distributes the process of rewarding relays for their bandwidth contributions. Bandwidth measurement is done directly as part of the distributed mining process and provides strong guarantees. Also, by utilizing a group of assignment authorities that may have more information about the system or underlying network, there is a lot of potential for generating more secure paths for clients than clients are able to generate for themselves.</p>\n<p>TorCoin still has some issues to work out; it may be possible to fix some of the smaller issues with protocol modifications, but some of the larger issues don’t have obvious solutions.</p>\n<p>One drawback to TorCoin is that it requires the group of collectively-trusted assignment authorities (you have to trust only that some threshold/quorum number of them are correct) to generate and assign circuits to clients. This is a similar trust model to the current Tor directory authorities. In practice, the assignment authorities cause availability issues: if a majority of the assignment authorities are unreachable, e.g. due to DoS or censorship, then the system is unusable to the clients because they won’t be able to generate circuits. This is also somewhat true of the directory authorities, however, directory information can be signed and then mirrored and distributed by other relays in the system whereas assignment authorities are required to always be online and available to new clients. TorCoin clients contact the assignment authorities in order to build new circuits, whereas in Tor they can build as many circuits as they need once the directory information is retrieved (from the directory auths or from directory mirrors).</p>\n<p>TorCoin as written has significant security issues. Because relay assignment is not based on bandwidth, it is easier for an adversary to get into the first and last position on a circuit and break anonymity. This can be done through a sybil attack by adding an arbitrary number of bad relays and joining them to the network without actually providing bandwidth. Because the protocol reveals  which ephemeral keys are attached to the assigned circuits, an adversary can confirm when it has compromised a circuit (has malicious nodes in the correct positions) without needing to do any statistical correlation attack (it can match up the ephemeral keys assigned to its malicious relays to the ones posted in the circuit assignment list). </p>\n<p>The formation of relay/client groups is not discussed and is similarly vulnerable to sybil attacks where the adversary can completely subvert the coin mining process. This can be done by registering an arbitrary number of relays and clients with the assignment servers, such that a large majority of circuits created by the assignment process will contain malicious relays in all positions and be assigned to a malicious client. This malicious collective of nodes can then “pretend” to send bytes through the circuit without actually doing so, and gain an advantage when mining coins. The paper suggests to use a persistent guard, which means the adversary only needs malicious relays in the middle and exit positions of its sybil client circuits, exponentially increasing the probability of a full compromise (or requiring far fewer nodes to achieve the same probability of compromise as without persistent guards). (The sybil clients only have to get 2 of its relays in the circuit instead of 3, reducing the probability from f^3 to f^2 for malicious fraction f.) Further, even if some relays on a circuit are honest, it is not rational for them to refuse to sign proofs of bandwidth that have been exaggerated (too high) by other relays. It will only benefit a relay to ignore proof-of-bandwidth checks, giving it an advantage over completely honest nodes in the TorCoin mining process.</p>\n<p>There are a variety of unaddressed practical deployment issues as well. It is not clear how to do load balancing with TorCoin alone - no one should be able to determine how many bytes were sent by any of the circuit members or where the payments for mined coins are being sent (anonymous TorCoin transactions are necessary for anonymity). Exit policies are not discussed, and there is no clear way to support them and for a client that would like to request a specific exit port. Its not clear how to ensure that a relay is not chosen for the same circuit twice, or two relays from the same relay family are not on the same circuit. Finally, it is not clear how to link ephemeral circuit keys to TorCoin addresses so that payments may be sent from clients to relays without revealing client identity.</p>\n<p>Don't misunderstand my ranting here - I think that the TorCoin idea is great (I am a co-author after all). It has the potential to motivate new researchers and developers to start thinking about solutions to problems that Tor is interested in, particularly bandwidth measurement. However, the limitations need to be clear so that we don't start seeing production systems using it and claiming to provide security without working through <b>*at least*</b> the issues mentioned above. The current paper was an initial concept in its early stages, and I expect the system to improve significantly as it is furthered developed.</p>\n<p>(For completeness, we should also point out that TorCoin will need a new name if anybody decides to build it. The <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq#researchpapers\">Tor trademark faq</a> says it's fine for research paper designs to use the Tor mark, but if it becomes actual software then it sure will be confusing to users and the rest of the Tor community about whether it's written by or endorsed by Tor.)</p>\n<p>Note that TorCoin and TEARS are at least somewhat complementary, since TEARS <b>*needs*</b> a proof-of-bandwidth scheme, and TorCoin <b>*provides*</b> one. However, they’re also not directly compatible. TorCoin requires a substantial change to both Bitcoin and to Tor (or to put it another way, it would be a system that only partially resembles Bitcoin and only partially resembles Tor). On the other hand, TEARS leaves Tor's circuit-finding mechanism intact, and the token protocol in TEARS is closer to traditional anonymous e-cash systems than to Bitcoin.</p>\n<h2><a id=\"better_or_worse\" href=\"#better_or_worse\">For better or for worse?</a></h2>\n<p>As outlined above, recent research has made great improvements in the area of Tor incentives. More work is needed to show the feasibility and efficiency of the decentralized approaches, and a secure bandwidth measurement scheme would help fill a critical piece missing from TEARS. Recent improvements to the way Tor schedules sockets and circuits would be necessary to correctly provide traffic priority (see <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12541\">#12541</a>), and then a differentiated services scheduler that is able to prioritize traffic by classes (already described in and prototyped for the BRAIDS, LIRA, and TEARS papers) would also be needed.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it is unclear how to make headway on the social issues. A small scale rollout of an \"experimental build\" to those relays who want to support new incentive features could be one way to test a new approach without committing to anything long term.</p>\n<p>One question that is often raised is: if an incentive scheme rewards relays for providing bandwidth, then won’t everyone just pick the same cheapest hosting provider and Tor will lose location diversity? This question is largely addressed in the discussion of what constitutes a useful service in the TEARS paper (the TEARS paper and appendices also gives useful commentary on many of the common problems and design decisions to make when designing an incentive scheme). Basically, it can be addressed in the monetary policy, e.g., in addition to rewarding relays for bandwidth, the bank could also assign weights that could be used to adjust the rewards based on certain flags that relays possess, or the geographic location in which they operate. This could be adjusted over time so that there would be a higher incentive to run relays in parts of the world where none exist, or to prefer exit relays over other positions, etc. Although, note that it is unclear exactly what the \"correct\" utility function should be and when/how it should be adjusted. Note that <a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/\">Torservers.net</a> similarly rewards relays for location diversity (<a href=\"https://blog.torservers.net/20140610/reimbursement-report-2014-05.html\">see here</a>).</p>\n<p>Another point to make here is that most of these approaches have nothing to do with giving out or transferring real dollars. The tokens in most of these schemes are useful only to receive traffic priority in Tor. Will there be third party markets that form around the exchange of the tokens? Sure. And they may be speculated. But at the end of the day, the tokens would still only provide prioritized traffic. Depending on the configuration of the priority scheduler, the difference between priority traffic and normal traffic may not be that extreme. It is conceivable that the tokens would not be worth nearly enough to compensate an operator for the ISP connection, much less the overhead involved with updating the software, maintaining the machine, and talking with the ISP -- and in that case we are still on the more conservative side of the social incentive discussions above.</p>\n<p>Tor has some choices to make in terms of how to grow the network and how to position the community during that growth process. I hope that this post, and the research presented herein, will at least help the community understand some of the options that are available.</p>\n<p>All the best, ~<a href=\"http://www.robgjansen.com\">Rob</a></p>\n<p>[Thanks to Roger Dingledine, Bryan Ford, Aaron Johnson, Andrew Miller, and Paul Syverson for input and feedback on this post.]</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the twenty-eighth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Roundup of research on incentives for running Tor relays</h1>\n<p>As an hors-d’œuvre to the now <a href=\"https://petsymposium.org/2014/\">on-going the Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium</a>, Rob Jansen wrote <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-incentives-research-roundup-goldstar-par-braids-lira-tears-and-torcoin\">a long blog post covering the last five years of research on incentives for running Tor relays</a>.</p>\n<p>Rob introduces the topic by describing the current “volunteer resource model” and mentions that “has succeeded so far: Tor now consists of over 5000 relays transferring between 4 and 5 GiB/s in aggregate”. Rob lists several possible reasons why volunteers run relays right now. They are all intrinsic motivations: current operators run relays because they really want to.</p>\n<p>Is only relying on volunteers going to limit the growth of the Tor network in the future? There are already <a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/\">not-for-profit organizations</a> operating relays based on donations, but growing them too much would also be problematic. Another area being explored are extrinsic motivations: making Tor clients faster when someone runs a relay or giving a financial reward — in a currency or another — for the service. Some can legitimately ask if they are <a href=\"http://p2pfoundation.net/Intrinsic_vs._Extrinsic_Motivation#Why_Extrinsic_Motivation_Doesn.27t_Work\">suitable for Tor at all</a> and Rob raises plenty of legitimate concerns on how they would interact with the current set of volunteers.</p>\n<p>The problem keeps interesting researchers, and Rob details no less than six schemes: the oldest are <a href=\"http://cs.gmu.edu/~astavrou/research/Par_PET_2008.pdf\">PAR</a> and <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/papers/incentives-fc10.pdf\">Gold Star</a> which introduced anonymity problems, <a href=\"http://www.robgjansen.com/publications/braids-ccs2010.pdf\">BRAIDS</a> where double spending of rewards is prevented without leaking timing information, <a href=\"http://www.robgjansen.com/publications/lira-ndss2013.pdf\">LIRA</a> which focused on scalability, <a href=\"http://www.robgjansen.com/publications/tears-hotpets2014.pdf\">TEARS</a> where a publicly auditable e-cash protocol reduce the reliance on trusted parties, and finally, the (<a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq#researchpapers\">not ideally named</a>) <a href=\"http://www.robgjansen.com/publications/torpath-hotpets2014.pdf\">TorCoin</a> which introduces the idea of a crypto-currency based on “proof-of-bandwidth”.</p>\n<p>Rob details the novel ideas and drawbacks of each schemes, so be sure to read the original blog post for more details. After this roundup, Rob highlights that “recent research has made great improvements in the area of Tor incentives”. But that’s for the technical side as “it is unclear how to make headway on the social issues”.</p>\n<p>“Tor has some choices to make in terms of how to grow the network and how to position the community during that growth process” concludes Rob. So let’s have that conversation.</p>\n<h1>Defending against guard discovery attacks with layered rotation time</h1>\n<p>Guard nodes are a key component of a Tor client’s anonymity. Once an attacker gains knowledge of which guard node is being used by a particular client, putting the guard node under monitoring is likely the last step before finding a client’s IP address.</p>\n<p>George Kadianakis has restarted the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007122.html\">discussion</a> on how to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9001\">slow down guard discovery of hidden services</a> by exploring the idea of “keeping our middle nodes more static”. The idea is to slow down the attacks based on repeated circuit destruction by reusing the same “middle nodes for 3-4 days instead of choosing new ones for every circuit”. Introducing this new behavior will slow down the attack, but George asks “are there any serious negative implications?”</p>\n<p>The idea is not new, as Paul Syverson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007125.html\">pointed out</a>: “Lasse and I suggested and explored the idea of layered guards when we introduced guards”. He adds “there are lots of possibilities here”.</p>\n<p>George worries that middle nodes would then “always see your traffic coming through your guard (assuming a single guard per client)”. Ian Goldberg <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007123.html\">added</a> “the exit will now know that circuits coming from the same middle are more likely to be the same client”. Restricting the change to only hidden services and not every client means that it will be “easy for an entry guard to learn whether a client has static middle nodes or not”.</p>\n<p>As George puts it the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007126.html\">latest message in the thread</a>: “As always, more research is needed…” Please help!</p>\n<h1>More monthly status reports for June 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of June continued, with submissions from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-July/000587.html\">Michael Schloh von Bennewitz</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-July/000588.html\">Andrew Lewman</a>.</p>\n<p>Arturo Filastò reported on behalf of <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-July/000586.html\">the OONI team</a>, while Roger Dingledine submitted the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-July/000589.html\">SponsorF report</a></p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>The various roadmaps that came out of the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014SummerDevMeeting\">2014 summer dev. meeting</a> have been <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2014SummerDevMeeting/Roadmaps\">transcribed</a> in a joint effort by George Kadianakis, Yawning Angel, Karsten Loesing, and an anonymous person.

This is a part time position, approximately 20 hours per week, at the office in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>The Tails developers announced the creation of two new mailing lists. “<a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-July/006330.html\">If you are a designer, UX/UI expert or beginner</a>” interested in the theory and practice of designing user interfaces for Tails, the <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-ux\">tails-ux list</a> is for you, while the <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/listinfo/tails-project\">tails-project list</a> is dedicated to “<a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-July/006329.html\">the ‘life’ of the project</a>“; however, “technical questions should stay on tails-dev”.</p>\n<p>Alan kicked of the aforementioned tails-ux mailing list <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-ux/2014-July/000000.html\">announcing progress</a> on Tails initial login screen. The new set of mockups is visible on the corresponding <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/blueprint/tails-greeter:_revamp_UI/\">blueprint</a>.</p>\n<p>More mockups! Nima Fatemi <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007115.html\">produced</a> some for a possible browser-based Tor control panel, incorporating features that were lost with the removal of Vidalia from the Tor Browser, such as the world map with Tor circuit visualizations. “How would you perfect <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~nima/ux/about-tor.png\">that image</a>?

The Onionoo service is maintained by Karsten.  Atlas was written by Arturo as proof-of-concept for the Onionoo service and later maintained (but not extended) by Philipp.  Globe was forked from Atlas by Christian who improved and maintained it for half a year, but who unfortunately disappeared a couple of weeks ago.  That leaves us with no actively maintained network status website, which is bad.</p>\n<p>Want to help out?</p>\n<p>Here's how: Globe has been criticized for having too much whitespace, which makes it less useful on smaller screens.  But we hear that the web technology behind Globe is superior to the one behind Atlas (we're no front-end web experts, so we can't say for sure).  A fine next step could be to fork Globe and tidy up its design to work better on smaller screens.  And there are plenty of steps after that if you look through the tickets in the Globe and Atlas component of our <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/\">bug tracker</a>.  Be sure to present your fork on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-dev\">tor-dev@ mailing list</a> early to get feedback.  You can just run it on your own server for now.</p>\n<p>The long-term goal would be to have one or more people working on a new network status website to replace Atlas and Globe.  We'd like to wait with that step until such a new website is maintained for a couple of weeks or even months though.  And even then, we may keep Atlas and Globe running for a couple more months.  But eventually, we'd like to shut them down in favor of an actively maintained website.</p>\n<p>Let us know if you're interested, and we're happy to provide more details and discuss ideas with you.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the twenty-ninth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tails 1.1 is out!</h1>\n<p>Tails, the Debian-based live system that protects its users’ communications by ensuring they are all sent through the Tor network, has been updated. This <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.1/\">new 1.1 release</a> reminds Tails users of the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/contribute/relationship_with_upstream/\">distribution’s roots in Debian</a>: Tails is now based on the current stable version of Debian, dubbed “Wheezy”.</p>\n<p>This means that almost all software components have been updated. One noticeable example is the desktop environment. The user experience of the GNOME 3 in fallback mode should be similar to previous Tails versions, but things will look a bit differently than they used to.</p>\n<p>One of the most keenly-awaited features of this new version is the support for UEFI firmware. Mac users now have only to <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/start_tails/#usb-mac\">press the Alt key</a> while booting their computer to start Tails from a DVD or USB stick. The same goes for owners of computers displaying “Windows 8” stickers. And, talking of Windows 8, the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/startup_options/windows_camouflage/\">camouflage mode</a> has been updated to look more like it, instead of the now discontinued XP.</p>\n<p>This new release also contains <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/security/Numerous_security_holes_in_1.0.1\">security fixes</a>, and minor tweaks over the previous versions.</p>\n<p>Because of the newly-introduced support for UEFI and the amount of upgraded software, incremental upgrades will not be offered for Tails 1.1. A full upgrade is needed through the Tails Installer. The safest method for upgrading Tails sticks is to go through a freshly burned DVD. Be sure to have a look at the list of <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.1/#index2h1\">known issues</a> to learn about other oddities that might happen in the process.</p>\n<h1>PETS 2014</h1>\n<p>The fourteenth Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium was held in Amsterdam, Netherlands, July 16-18, 2014. A wide range of research in privacy enhancing technologies was presented, with many of relevance to Tor. Keynotes were given by Martin Ortlieb, Senior User Experience Researcher in Privacy at Google, and William Binney, a former NSA employee.</p>\n<p>Some papers focusing on Tor include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://petsymposium.org/2014/papers/Winter.pdf\">Spoiled Onions: Exposing Malicious Tor Exit Relays</a> by Philipp Winter, Richard Köwer, Martin Mulazzani, Markus Huber, Sebastian Schrittwieser, Stefan Lindskog, and Edgar Weippl</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://petsymposium.org/2014/papers/Dingledine.pdf\">One Fast Guard for Life (or 9 months)</a> by Roger Dingledine, Nicholas Hopper, George Kadianakis, and Nick Mathewson</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://petsymposium.org/2014/papers/Jansen.pdf\">From Onions to Shallots: Rewarding Tor Relays with TEARS</a> by Rob Jansen, Andrew Miller, Paul Syverson, and Bryan Ford</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://petsymposium.org/2014/papers/Ghosh.pdf\">A TorPath to TorCoin: Proof-of-Bandwidth Altcoins for Compensating Relays</a> by Mainak Ghosh, Miles Richardson, Bryan Ford, and Rob Jansen</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://petsymposium.org/2014/papers/Thomas.pdf\">Measuring the Leakage of Onion at the Root, A measurement of Tor’s .onion pseudo-top-level domain in the global domain name system</a> by Matthew Thomas and Aziz Mohaisen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also announced at PETS was the 2014 PET Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies, for <a href=\"https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/shmat/a-scanner-darkly-protecting-user-privacy-from-perceptual-applications/\">A Scanner Darkly: Protecting User Privacy From Perceptual Applications</a> by Suman Jana, Arvind Narayanan†, and Vitaly Shmatikov. The winner of the best student paper at PETS was <a href=\"https://petsymposium.org/2014/papers/Miller.pdf\">I Know Why You Went to the Clinic: Risks and Realization of HTTPS Traffic Analysis</a> by Brad Miller, Ling Huang, A. D.  Joseph and J. D. Tygar .</p>\n<p>Prior to PETS, there was a Tor meet-up which Moritz Bartl reported as a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-July/033936.html\">great success</a>. Hopefully there will also be such an event at the 2015 PETS, to be held in Philadelphia, US, in the week of June 29, 2015.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://pypi.python.org/pypi/txtorcon\">txtorcon</a>, the Tor control protocol implementation for the <a href=\"https://twistedmatrix.com/\">Twisted framework</a>, received a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007166.html\">new minor release</a>. Version 0.10.1 fixes “a couple bugs introduced along with the endpoints feature in 0.10.0”.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/recent-black-hat-2014-talk-cancellation\">posted</a> an official reaction to the cancellation of a proposed talk at the upcoming Blackhat2014 conference dealing with possible deanonymization attacks on Tor users and hidden services.</p>\n<p>Tor ships with a <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/contrib/operator-tools/tor-exit-notice.html\">sample webpage</a> that can be used by exit node operators to identify their system as such to anyone wishing to identify the source of Tor traffic. Operators most often copy and adapt this template to the local situation. Mick Morgan discovered than his version was <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-July/004982.html\">out of sync</a> and contained broken links. “If other operators are similarly using a page based on the old template, they may wish to update”, Mick advised.</p>\n<p>Michael Rogers, one of the developers of <a href=\"https://briarproject.org/\">Briar</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007161.html\">announced</a> a <a href=\"https://fulpool.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/hidden-services\">new mailing list</a> for discussing peer-to-peer-based communication systems based on Tor hidden services. As Briar and other systems might be “running into similar issues”, a shared place to discuss them seemed worthwhile.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing and Philipp Winter are <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/looking-front-end-web-developers-network-status-websites-atlas-and-globe\">looking for front-end web developers</a>: “We are looking for somebody to fork and extend one of the two main Tor network status websites <a href=\"https://atlas.torproject.org/\">Atlas</a> or <a href=\"https://globe.torproject.org/\">Globe</a>” writes Karsten. Both websites currently need love and new maintainers. Please reach out if you want to help!</p>\n<p>The database which holds Tor bridges, usually called <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/bridgedb.git\">BridgeDB</a>, is able to give out bridge addresses through email. This feature was recently extended to make the email autoresponder support more bridge types, which required introducing new keywords that must be used in the initial request. Matthew Finkel is looking for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007164.html\">feedback</a> on the current set of commands and how they could be improved.</p>\n<p>Lunar wrote a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-July/000593.html\">detailed report</a> on his week at the Libre Software Meeting in Montpellier, France. The report covers the booth jointly held with <a href=\"https://nos-oignons.net/\">Nos Oignons</a>, his talk in the security track, and several contacts made with other free software projects.</p>\n<p>Here’s another round of reports from Google Summer of Code students: the mid-term: Amogh Pradeep on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007152.html\">Orbot and Orfox improvements</a>, Israel Leiva on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007156.html\">GetTor revamp</a>, Quinn Jarrell on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007157.html\">pluggable transport combiner</a>, Juha Nurmi on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-July/000594.html\">ahmia.fi project</a>, Marc Juarez on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-July/000595.html\">website fingerprinting defenses</a>, and Daniel Martí on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007163.html\">incremental updates to consensus documents</a>.</p>\n<p>Tim Retout <a href=\"http://retout.co.uk/blog/2014/07/21/apt-transport-tor\">announced</a> that <a href=\"https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/apt-transport-tor\">apt-transport-tor</a> 0.2.1 has entered Debian unstable. This package enables APT to download Debian packages through Tor. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://atlas.torproject.org/\">Atlas</a> can now also be used to search for Tor bridges. In the past, Atlas was only able to search for relays. This was made possible thanks to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/6320\">a patch</a> developed by Dmitry Eremin-Solenikov.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-July/000642.html\">Tim Semeijn</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-July/000646.html\">Tobias Bauer</a> for setting up new mirrors of the Tor Project’s website and its software.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Some Linux users have experienced missing dependency errors when trying to install Tor Browser from their operating system’s software repositories. Tor Browser should only be installed from the Tor Project’s website, and never from a software repository. In other words, using apt-get or yum to install Tor Browser is discouraged. Downloading and verifying Tor Browser from the Tor Project website allows users to keep up with important security updates as they are released.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>user3224 wants to log in to its Google, Microsoft etc. accounts and wonders <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3603/88\">if they will know the real name and other personal information</a>. Roya and mirimir explained that if someone logs into an already personalized account Tor can’t anonymize this user. Instead it might be wise to use Tor to register a pseudonym and also use an anonymous operating system like Tails or Whonix.</p>\n<p>escapologybb has set up a Raspberry Pi. It serves as SOCKS proxy for the internal network. While everyone can use it, escapologybb asks what the security implications are and <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3596/88\">if this lowers the overall anonymity</a>. If you know a good answer please share your knowledge with the users of Tor StackExchange.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, Steven Murdoch, harmony, Philipp Winter, Matt Pagan, qbi, and Karsten Loesing.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>We now have a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReportingBadRelays\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki page</a> which explains how bad relays should be reported to the Tor Project.  A bad relay can be malicious, misconfigured, or otherwise broken.  Once such a relay is reported, a subset of vigilant Tor developers (currently Roger, Peter, Damian, Karsten, and I) first tries to reproduce the issue.  If it's reproducible, we attempt to get in touch with the relay operator and work on the issue together.  However, if the relay has no contact information or we cannot reach the operator, we will resort to assigning flags (such as BadExit) to the reported relay which instructs clients to no longer use the relay in the future. In severe cases, we are also able to remove the relay descriptor from the network consensus which effectively makes the relay disappear. To get an idea of what bad behavior was documented in the past, have a look at this (no longer maintained) <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/badRelays\" rel=\"nofollow\">wiki page</a> or these <a href=\"http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mikepo/papers/tordecoys.raid11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">research</a> <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/pets2014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">papers</a>.</p>\n<p>We regularly scan the network for bad relays using <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/phw/exitmap.git\" rel=\"nofollow\">exitmap</a> but there are several other great tools such as <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torflow.git/blob/HEAD:/NetworkScanners/ExitAuthority/README.ExitScanning\" rel=\"nofollow\">Snakes on a Tor</a>, <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/torscanner/\" rel=\"nofollow\">torscanner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/tortunnel/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tortunnel</a>, and <a href=\"http://detector.io/DetecTor.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">DetecTor</a>.  We are also dependent on the wider community to help us spot relays which don't act as they should. So if you think that you stumbled upon a bad relay while using Tor, please report it to us by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:bad-relays@lists.torproject.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">bad-relays@lists.torproject.org</a>. To find out which relay is currently being used as your exit relay, please visit our <a href=\"https://check.torproject.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Check service</a>. Just tell us the relay's IP address (Check tells you what your IP address appears to be) and the behavior you observed. Then, we can begin to investigate!</p>"

Most components have been updated and a couple of small issues fixed. Details are available in the release announcement.</p>\n<p>The release fixes <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox24.7\">import security updates</a> from Firefox. Be sure to <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html\">upgrade</a>! Users of the experimental <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a> bundles have <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/pt-bundle/3.6.3-meek-1/\">not been forgotten</a>.</p>\n<h1>New Tor stable and alpha releases</h1>\n<p>Two new releases of Tor are out. The new <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-July/034180.html\">0.2.5.6-alpha release</a> “brings us a big step closer to slowing down the risk from guard rotation, and fixes a variety of other issues to get us closer to a release candidate”.</p>\n<p>Once directory authorities have upgraded, they will “assign the Guard flag to the fastest 25% of the network”. Some experiments showed that “for the current network, this results in about 1100 guards, down from 2500.”</p>\n<p>The complementary change to <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/236-single-guard-node.txt\">moving the number of entry guards down to one</a> is the introduction of two new consensus parameters. <em>NumEntryGuards</em> and <em>NumDirectoryGuards</em> will respectively set the number of entry guards and directory guards that clients will use. The default for <em>NumEntryGuards</em> is currently three, but this will allow a reversible switch to one in a near future.</p>\n<p>Several important fixes have been backported to the stable branch in the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2014-July/000093.html\">0.2.4.23 release</a>. Source packages are available at the regular location <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\"></a>. Binary packages have already landed in Debian (<a href=\"https://tracker.debian.org/news/560607\">unstable</a>, <a href=\"https://tracker.debian.org/news/560611\">experimental</a>) and the rest should follow shortly.</p>\n<h1>Security issue in Tails 1.1 and earlier</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/security/Security_hole_in_I2P_0.9.13/\">Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in I2P which is shipped in Tails 1.1 and earlier</a>. <a href=\"https://geti2p.net/\">I2P</a> is an anonymous overlay network with many similarities to Tor. There was quite some confusion around the disclosure process of this vulnerability. Readers are encouraged to read <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/On_0days_exploits_and_disclosure/\">what the Tails team has written about it</a>.</p>\n<p>Starting I2P in Tails normally requires a click on the relevant menu entry. Once started, the security issues can lead to the deanonymization of a Tails user who visits a malicious web page. As a matter of precaution, the Tails team recommends removing the “i2p” package each time Tails is started.</p>\n<p>I2P has fixed the issue in <a href=\"https://geti2p.net/en/blog/post/2014/07/26/0.9.14-Release\">version 0.9.14</a>. It is likely to be included in the next Tails release, but the team is also <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-July/006459.html\">discussing</a> implementing more in-depth protections that would be required in order to keep I2P in Tails.</p>\n<h1>Reporting bad relays</h1>\n<p>“Bad” relays are malicious, misconfigured, or otherwise broken Tor relays. As anyone is free to volunteer bandwidth and processing power to spin up a new relay, users can encounter such bad relays once in a while. Getting them out of everyone’s circuits is thus important.</p>\n<p>Damian Johnson and Philipp Winter have been working on <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReportingBadRelays\">improving and documenting</a> the process of reporting bad relays. “While we do regularly scan the network for bad relays, we are also dependent on the wider community to help us spot relays which don’t act as they should” <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-report-bad-relays\">wrote</a> Philipp.</p>\n<p>When observing unusual behaviors, one way to learn about the current exit relay before reporting it is to use the <a href=\"https://check.torproject.org/\">Check</a> service. This method can be inaccurate and tends to be a little bit cumbersome. The good news is that Arthur Edelstein is <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/8641#comment:12\">busy integrating</a> more feedback on Tor circuits being used directly into the Tor Browser.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>The Tor Project, Inc. has completed its <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/transparency-openness-and-our-2013-financials\">standard financial audit for the year 2013</a>. <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2013-TorProject-Form990.pdf\">IRS Form 990</a>, <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2013-TorProject-FormPC.pdf\">Massachusetts Form PC</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/findoc/2013-TorProject-FinancialStatements.pdf\">Financial Statements</a> are now available for anyone to review.

    "content": "<p>This advisory was posted on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2014-July/000094.html\">tor-announce</a> mailing list.</p>\n<h2>SUMMARY:</h2>\n<p>On July 4 2014 we found a group of relays that we assume were trying to deanonymize users. They appear to have been targeting people who operate or access Tor hidden services. The attack involved modifying Tor protocol headers to do traffic confirmation attacks.</p>\n<p>The attacking relays joined the network on January 30 2014, and we removed them from the network on July 4. While we don't know when they started doing the attack, users who operated or accessed hidden services from early February through July 4 should assume they were affected.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, it's still unclear what \"affected\" includes. We know the attack looked for users who fetched hidden service descriptors, but the attackers likely were not able to see any application-level traffic (e.g. what pages were loaded or even whether users visited the hidden service they looked up). The attack probably also tried to learn who published hidden service descriptors, which would allow the attackers to learn the location of that hidden service. In theory the attack could also be used to link users to their destinations on normal Tor circuits too, but we found no evidence that the attackers operated any exit relays, making this attack less likely. And finally, we don't know how much data the attackers kept, and due to the way the attack was deployed (more details below), their protocol header modifications might have aided other attackers in deanonymizing users too.</p>\n<p>Relays should upgrade to a recent Tor release (<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2014-July/000093.html\">0.2.4.23</a> or <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-July/034180.html\">0.2.5.6-alpha</a>), to close the particular protocol vulnerability the attackers used &mdash; but remember that preventing traffic confirmation in general remains an open research problem. Clients that upgrade (once new Tor Browser releases are ready) will take another step towards limiting the number of entry guards that are in a position to see their traffic, thus reducing the damage from future attacks like this one. Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of their hidden service.</p>\n<h2>THE TECHNICAL DETAILS:</h2>\n<p>We believe they used a combination of two classes of attacks: a traffic confirmation attack and a Sybil attack.</p>\n<p>A traffic confirmation attack is possible when the attacker controls or observes the relays on both ends of a Tor circuit and then compares traffic timing, volume, or other characteristics to conclude that the two relays are indeed on the same circuit. If the first relay in the circuit (called the \"entry guard\") knows the IP address of the user, and the last relay in the circuit knows the resource or destination she is accessing, then together they can deanonymize her. You can read more about traffic confirmation attacks, including pointers to many research papers, at this blog post from 2009:<br />\n<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough\">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough</a></p>\n<p>The particular confirmation attack they used was an active attack where the relay on one end injects a signal into the Tor protocol headers, and then the relay on the other end reads the signal. These attacking relays were stable enough to get the HSDir (\"suitable for hidden service directory\") and Guard (\"suitable for being an entry guard\") <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/dir-spec.txt#l1775\">consensus flags</a>. Then they injected the signal whenever they were used as a hidden service directory, and looked for an injected signal whenever they were used as an entry guard.</p>\n<p>The way they injected the signal was by sending sequences of \"relay\" vs \"relay early\" commands down the circuit, to encode the message they want to send. For <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/tor-spec.txt#l364\">background</a>, Tor has two types of cells: link cells, which are intended for the adjacent relay in the circuit, and relay cells, which are passed to the other end of the circuit. In 2008 we added a new kind of relay cell, called a \"relay early\" cell, which is used to prevent people from building very long paths in the Tor network. (Very long paths can be used to <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/110-avoid-infinite-circuits.txt \">induce congestion</a> and aid in <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#congestion-longpaths\">breaking anonymity</a>). But the fix for infinite-length paths introduced a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1038\">problem with accessing hidden services</a>, and one of the side effects of our fix for bug 1038 was that while we limit the number of outbound (away from the client) \"relay early\" cells on a circuit, we <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-commits/2009-July/014679.html\">don't limit</a> the number of inbound (towards the client) relay early cells.</p>\n<p>So in summary, when Tor clients contacted an attacking relay in its role as a Hidden Service Directory to publish or retrieve a hidden service descriptor (steps 2 and 3 on <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services\">the hidden service protocol diagrams</a>), that relay would send the hidden service name (encoded as a pattern of relay and relay-early cells) back down the circuit. Other attacking relays, when they get chosen for the first hop of a circuit, would look for inbound relay-early cells (since nobody else sends them) and would thus learn which clients requested information about a hidden service.</p>\n<p>There are three important points about this attack:</p>\n<p><b>A)</b> The attacker encoded the name of the hidden service in the injected signal (as opposed to, say, sending a random number and keeping a local list mapping random number to hidden service name). The encoded signal is encrypted as it is sent over the TLS channel between relays. However, this signal would be easy to read and interpret by anybody who runs a relay and receives the encoded traffic. And we might also worry about a global adversary (e.g. a large intelligence agency) that records Internet traffic at the entry guards and then tries to break Tor's link encryption. The way this attack was performed weakens Tor's anonymity against these other potential attackers too &mdash; either while it was happening or after the fact if they have traffic logs. So if the attack was a research project (i.e. not intentionally malicious), it was deployed in an irresponsible way because it puts users at risk indefinitely into the future.</p>\n<p>(This concern is in addition to the general issue that it's probably unwise from a legal perspective for researchers to attack real users by modifying their traffic on one end and wiretapping it on the other. Tools like <a href=\"http://shadow.github.io/\">Shadow</a> are great for testing Tor research ideas out in the lab.)</p>\n<p><b>B)</b> This protocol header signal injection attack is actually pretty neat from a research perspective, in that it's a bit different from previous tagging attacks which targeted the application-level payload. Previous tagging attacks modified the payload at the entry guard, and then looked for a modified payload at the exit relay (which can see the decrypted payload). Those attacks don't work in the other direction (from the exit relay back towards the client), because the payload is still encrypted at the entry guard. But because this new approach modifies (\"tags\") the cell headers rather than the payload, every relay in the path can see the tag.</p>\n<p><b>C)</b> We should remind readers that while this particular variant of the traffic confirmation attack allows high-confidence and efficient correlation, the general class of passive (statistical) traffic confirmation attacks remains unsolved and would likely have worked just fine here. So the good news is traffic confirmation attacks aren't new or surprising, but the bad news is that they still work. See <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough\">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough</a> for more discussion.</p>\n<p>Then the second class of attack they used, in conjunction with their traffic confirmation attack, was a standard <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack\">Sybil attack</a> &mdash; they signed up around 115 fast non-exit relays, all running on 50.7.0.0/16 or 204.45.0.0/16. Together these relays summed to about 6.4% of the Guard capacity in the network. Then, in part because of our current <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters\"> guard rotation parameters</a>, these relays became entry guards for a significant chunk of users over their five months of operation.</p>\n<p>We actually noticed these relays when they joined the network, since the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/doctor.git\">DocTor</a> scanner <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-consensus-health/2014-January/004134.html\">reported them</a>.  We considered the set of new relays at the time, and made a decision that it wasn't that large a fraction of the network. It's clear there's room for improvement in terms of how to let the Tor network grow while also ensuring we maintain social connections with the operators of all large groups of relays. (In general having a widely diverse set of relay locations and relay operators, yet not allowing any bad relays in, seems like a hard problem; on the other hand our detection scripts did notice them in this case, so there's hope for a better solution here.)</p>\n<p>In response, we've taken the following short-term steps:</p>\n<p><b>1)</b> Removed the attacking relays from the network.</p>\n<p><b>2)</b> Put out a software update for relays to prevent \"relay early\" cells from being used this way.</p>\n<p><b>3)</b> Put out a software update that will (once enough clients have upgraded) let us tell clients to move to using one entry guard rather than three, to reduce exposure to relays over time.</p>\n<p><b>4)</b> Clients can tell whether they've received a relay or relay-cell. For expert users, the new Tor version warns you in your logs if a relay on your path injects any relay-early cells: look for the phrase \"Received an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell\".</p>\n<p>The following longer-term research areas remain:</p>\n<p><b>5)</b> Further growing the Tor network and diversity of relay operators, which will reduce the impact from an adversary of a given size.</p>\n<p><b>6)</b> Exploring better mechanisms, e.g. social connections, to limit the impact from a malicious set of relays. We've also formed a group to pay more attention to suspicious relays in the network:<br />\n<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-report-bad-relays\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-report-bad-relays\">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-report-bad-relays</a></p>\n<p><b>7)</b> Further reducing exposure to guards over time, perhaps by extending the guard rotation lifetime:<br />\n<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay\">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters\">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard...</a></p>\n<p><b>8)</b> Better understanding statistical traffic correlation attacks and whether padding or other approaches can mitigate them.</p>\n<p><b>9)</b> Improving the hidden service design, including making it harder for relays serving as hidden service directory points to learn what hidden service address they're handling:<br />\n<a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love\" title=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love\">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love</a></p>\n<h2>OPEN QUESTIONS:</h2>\n<p><b>Q1)</b> Was this the Black Hat 2014 talk that got canceled recently?<br />\n<b>Q2)</b> Did we find all the malicious relays?<br />\n<b>Q3)</b> Did the malicious relays inject the signal at any points besides the HSDir position?<br />\n<b>Q4)</b> What data did the attackers keep, and are they going to destroy it? How have they protected the data (if any) while storing it?</p>\n<p>Great questions. We spent several months trying to extract information from the researchers who were going to give the Black Hat talk, and eventually we did get some hints from them about how \"relay early\" cells could be used for traffic confirmation attacks, which is how we started looking for the attacks in the wild. They haven't answered our emails lately, so we don't know for sure, but it seems likely that the answer to Q1 is \"yes\". In fact, we hope they *were* the ones doing the attacks, since otherwise it means somebody else was. We don't yet know the answers to Q2, Q3, or Q4.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the thirty-first issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor and the RELAY_EARLY traffic confirmation attack</h1>\n<p>Roger Dingledine ended several months of concern and speculation in the Tor community with a security advisory posted to the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2014-July/000094.html\">tor-announce mailing list</a> and the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack\">Tor blog</a>.</p>\n<p>In it, he gave details of a five-month-long active attack on operators and users of Tor hidden services that involved a variant of the so-called “Sybil attack”: the attacker signed up “around 115 fast non-exit relays” (now removed from the Tor network), and configured them to inject a traffic header signal consisting of RELAY_EARLY cells to “tag” any hidden service descriptor requests received by malicious relays — a tag which could then be picked up by other bad nodes acting as <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#EntryGuards\">entry guards</a>, in the process identifying clients which requested information about a particular hidden service.</p>\n<p>The attack is suspected to be linked to a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/recent-black-hat-2014-talk-cancellation\">now-cancelled talk that was due to be delivered at the BlackHat security conference</a>. There have been several fruitful and positive research projects involving theoretical attacks on Tor’s security, but this was not among them. Not only were there problems with the process of responsible disclosure, but, as Roger wrote, “the attacker encoded the name of the hidden service in the injected signal (as opposed to, say, sending a random number and keeping a local list mapping random number to hidden service name)”, thereby “[putting] users at risk indefinitely into the future”.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it is important to note that “while this particular variant of the traffic confirmation attack allows high-confidence and efficient correlation, the general class of passive (statistical) traffic confirmation attacks remains unsolved and would likely have worked just fine here”. In other words, the tagging mechanism used in this case is the innovation; the other element of the attack is a known weakness of low-latency anonymity systems, and defending against it is a much harder problem.</p>\n<p>“Users who operated or accessed hidden services from early February through July 4 should assume they were affected” and act accordingly; in the case of hidden service operators, this may mean changing the location of the service. Accompanying the advisory were two new releases for both the stable and alpha tor branches (0.2.4.23 and 0.2.5.6-alpha); both include a fix for the signal-injection issue that causes tor to drop circuits and give a warning if RELAY_EARLY cells are detected going in the wrong direction (towards the client), and both prepare the ground for clients to move to single entry guards (rather than sets of three) in the near future. Relay operators should be sure to upgrade; a point-release of the Tor Browser will offer the same fixes to ordinary users. Nusenu <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-August/005046.html\">suggested</a> that relay operators regularly check their logs for the new warning, “even if the attack origin is not directly attributable from a relay’s point of view”. Be sure to read the full security advisory for a fuller explanation of the attack and its implications.</p>\n<h1>Why is bad-relays a closed mailing list?</h1>\n<p>Damian Johnson and Philipp Winter have been working on improving the process of <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ReportingBadRelays\">reporting bad relays</a>. The process starts by having users report odd behaviors to the bad-relays mailing list.</p>\n<p>Only a few trusted volunteers receive and review these reports. Nusenu <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-July/034198.html\">started a discussion on tor-talk</a> advocating for more transparency. Nusenu argues that an open list would “likely get more confirm/can’t confirm feedback for a given badexit candidate”, and that it would allow worried users to act faster than operators of directory authorities.</p>\n<p>Despite being “usually on the side of transparency”, Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-July/034219.html\">described</a> being “stuck” on the issue, “because the arms race is so lopsidedly against us”.</p>\n<p>Roger explains: “we can scan for whether exit relays handle certain websites poorly, but if the list that we scan for is public, then exit relays can mess with other websites and know they’ll get away with it. We can scan for incorrect behavior on various ports, but if the list of ports and the set of behavior we do is public, then again relays are free to mess with things we don’t look for.”</p>\n<p>A better future and more transparency probably lies in adaptive test systems run by multiple volunteer groups. Until they come to existence, as a small improvement, Philipp Winter <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-July/034216.html\">wrote</a> it was probably safe to publish why relays were disabled, through “short sentence along the lines of ‘running HTTPS MitM’ or ‘running sslstrip’”.</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for July 2014</h1>\n<p>Time for monthly reports from Tor project members.

The event brought together policy and technology researchers who focus on Internet censorship and measurement. A lot of great work was presented including but not limited to a proposal to measure the chilling effect, ongoing work to deploy <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/usenix11-telex.pdf\">Telex</a>, and several projects to measure censorship in different countries. Some Tor-related work was also presented: Researchers are working on understanding how the Tor network is used for political purposes.

Starting with Firefox 14 the “nsILocalFile” interface has been <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10573\">deprecated and replaced with the “nsIFile” interface</a>. What we should do is replace all instances of “nsILocalFile” with “nsIFile” and see if anything else needs fixing to make Tor Launcher still work as expected. If you know a little bit about Firefox extensions and want to give this a try, clone the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-launcher.git\">repository</a>, make the necessary changes, run “make package”, and tell us whether something broke in interesting ways.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, harmony, Matt Pagan, Philipp Winter, David Fifield, Karsten Loesing, and Roger Dingledine.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the thirty-second issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Torsocks 2.0 is now considered stable</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torsocks.git/blob/HEAD:/README.md\">Torsocks</a> is a wrapper program that will force an application’s network connections to go through the Tor network. David Goulet <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007330.html\">released</a> version 2.0.0, blessing the new codebase as stable after <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2013-June/004959.html\">more than a year of efforts</a>.</p>\n<p>David’s original email highlighted several reasons for a complete rewrite of torsocks. Among the issues were maintainability, error handling, thread safety, and a lack of proper compatibility layer for multiple architectures. The new implementation addresses all these issues while staying about the same size as the previous version (4,000 lines of C according to sloccount), and test coverage has been vastly extended.</p>\n<p>Torsocks comes in handy when a piece of software does not natively support the use of a SOCKS proxy. In most cases, the new version may be safer, as torsocks will prevent DNS requests and non-torified connections from happening.</p>\n<p>Integrators and power users should watch their steps while migrating to the new version. The configuration file format has changed, and some applications might behave differently as more system calls are now restricted.</p>\n<h1>Next generation Hidden Services and Introduction Points</h1>\n<p>When Tor clients need to connect to a Hidden Service, the first step is to create a circuit to its “Introduction Point”. There, the Tor client serving the Hidden Service will be waiting through another circuit to agree on a “Rendezvous Point” and pursue the communication through circuits connecting to this freshly selected Tor node.</p>\n<p>This general design is not subject to any changes in the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt\">revision of hidden services</a> currently being worked on. But there are still some questions left unanswered regarding the best way to select Introduction Points. George Kadianakis <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007335.html\">summarized</a> them as: “How many IPs should an HS have? Which relays can be IPs? What’s the lifetime of an IP?”</p>\n<p>For each of these questions, George collected possible answers and assessed whether or not they could respond to several attacks identified in the past.  Anyone interested should help with the research needed and join the discussion.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Michael Rogers is also trying to <a href=\"https://fulpool.org/pipermail/hidden-services/2014-August/000019.html\">find ways</a> to improve hidden service performance in mobile contexts. One way to do so would be to “keep the set of introduction points as stable as possible”.  However, a naive approach to doing so would ease the job of attackers trying to locate a hidden service. The idea would be to always use the same guard and middle node for a given introduction point, but this might also open the doors to new attacks. Michael suggests experimenting with the recently published <a href=\"https://github.com/drgowen/tor-research-framework\">Java research framework</a> to gain a better understanding of the implications.</p>\n<h1>More status reports for July 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of July continued, with submissions from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000615.html\">Andrew Lewman</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000616.html\">Colin C.</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000617.html\">Damian Johnson</a>.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine sent out the report for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000619.html\">SponsorF</a>. Arturo Filastò described what the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000621.html\">OONI team</a> was up to. The <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/report_2014_06-07/\">Tails team</a> covered their activity for June and July.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Two Tor Browser releases are at QA stage: <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-August/000436.html\">4.0-alpha-1</a> including meek and a new directory layout, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-August/000439.html\">3.6.4</a> for security fixes.</p>\n<p>The recent serious <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack\">attack against Tor hidden services</a> was also a Sybil attack: a large number of malicious nodes joined the network at once. This led to a renewal of interest in detecting Sybil attacks against the Tor network more quickly. Karsten Loesing published <a href=\"https://github.com/kloesing/SAD\">some code</a> computing similarity metrics, and David Fifield has explored <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/12813\">visualizations</a> of the consensus that made the recent attack visible.</p>\n<p>Gareth Owen sent out an <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007328.html\">update</a> about the Java Tor Research Framework. This prompted a discussion with George Kadianakis and Tim about the best way to perform <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing\">fuzz testing</a> on Tor. Have a look if you want to comment on <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007334.html\">Tim’s approaches</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-August/000651.html\">Daniel Thill</a> for running a mirror of the Tor Project website!</p>\n<p>ban <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-August/005073.html\">mentioned</a> a new service collecting donations for the Tor network. <a href=\"https://oniontip.com/\">OnionTip</a>, set up by Donncha O’Cearbhaill, will collect bitcoins and redistribute them to relay operators who put a bitcoin address in their contact information. As the redistribution is currently done according to the consensus weight, Sebastian Hahn <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-August/005077.html\">warned</a> that this might encourage people to “cheat the consensus weight” because that now means “more money from oniontip”.</p>\n<p>Juha Nurmi sent <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000620.html\">another update</a> on the ahmia.fi GSoC project.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>arvee wants to <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3802/88\">redirect some TCP connections through Tor on OS X</a>; <a href=\"http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks/\">Redsocks</a> should help to route packets for port 443 over Tor .  mirimir explained that given the user's pf configuration, the setting “SocksPort 8888” was probably missing.</p>\n<p>meee asked a question and offered a bounty for an answer: the circuit handshake entry in Tor’s log file contains some numbers, and meee wants to <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3213/88\">know what their meaning is</a>: “Circuit handshake stats since last time: 1833867/1833868 TAP, 159257/159257 NTor.”</p>\n<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>\n<p>The bridge distributor <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/\">BridgeDB</a> usually gives out bridges by responding to user requests via HTTPS and email. A while ago, BridgeDB also gave out bridges to a very small number of people who would then redistribute bridges using their social network. We would like to resume sending bridges to these people, but only if BridgeDB can be <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9332\">made to send them via GnuPG-encrypted emails</a>. If you’d like to dive into the BridgeDB code and add support for GnuPG-encrypted emails, please take a look at the ticket and give it a try.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, qbi, Karsten Loesing, harmony, and Philipp Winter.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

For more details, see the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#Overview\">overview</a> and the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/AChildsGardenOfPluggableTransports#meek\">Child’s Garden of Pluggable Transports</a>.</p>\n<p>You only need meek if your Internet connection is censored so that you can’t use ordinary Tor. Even then, you should try other pluggable transports first, because they have less overhead. My recommended order for trying transports is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>obfs3</li>\n<li>fte</li>\n<li>scramblesuit</li>\n<li>meek</li>\n<li>flashproxy</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Use meek if other transports don’t work for you, or if you want to help development by testing it. I have been using meek for my day-to-day browsing for a few months now.</p>\n<p>All pluggable transports have some overhead. You might find that meek feels slower than ordinary Tor. We’re working on some tickets that will make it faster in the future: <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12428\" title=\"Make it possible to have multiple requests and responses in flight\">#12428</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12778\" title=\"Put meek HTTP headers on a diet\">#12778</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12857\" title=\"Use streaming downloads\">#12857</a>.</p>\n<p>At this point, there are two different backends supported. <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#AmazonCloudFront\">meek-amazon</a> makes it look like you are talking to an Amazon Web Services server (when you are actually talking to a Tor bridge), and <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#GoogleAppEngine\">meek-google</a> makes it look like you are talking to the Google search page (when you are actually talking to a Tor bridge).

    "content": "<p>In May, the <a href=\"https://www.opentechfund.org/\">Open Technology Fund</a> commissioned <a href=\"https://www.isecpartners.com/\">iSEC Partners</a> to study current and future hardening options for the Tor Browser. The Open Technology Fund is the primary funder of Tor Browser development, and it commissions security analysis and review for all of the projects that it funds as a standard practice. We worked with iSEC to define the scope of the engagement to focus on the following six main areas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Review of the current state of hardening in Tor Browser</li>\n<li>Investigate additional hardening options and instrumentation</li>\n<li>Perform historical vulnerability analysis on Firefox, in order to make informed vulnerability surface reduction recommendations</li>\n<li>Investigate image, audio, and video codecs and their respective library's vulnerability history</li>\n<li>Review our current about:config settings, both for vulnerability surface reduction and security</li>\n<li>Review alternate/obscure protocol and application handlers</li>\n</ol>\n<p><br>The <a href=\"https://github.com/iSECPartners/publications/tree/master/reports/Tor%20Browser%20Bundle\">complete report</a> is available in the iSEC publications github repo. All tickets related to the report can be found using the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=!closed&amp;keywords=~tbb-isec-report\">tbb-isec-report keyword</a>. General Tor Browser security tickets can be found using the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=!closed&amp;keywords=~tbb-security\">tbb-security keyword</a>.</p>\n<h1>Major Findings and Recommendations</h1>\n<p>The report had the following high-level findings and recommendations. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Address Space Layout Randomization is disabled on Windows and Mac</b></li>\n<p> <br>Due to our use of cross-compilation and non-standard toolchains in <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details\">our reproducible build system</a>, several hardening features have ended up disabled. We have known about the Windows issues prior to this report, and should have a fix for them soon. However, the MacOS issues are news to us, and appear to require that we build 64 bit versions of the Tor Browser for full support. The parent ticket for all basic hardening issues in Tor Browser is <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10065\">bug #10065</a>.<br />\n <br>\n<li><b>Participate in Pwn2Own</b></li>\n<p> <br>iSEC recommended that we find a sponsor to fund a <a href=\"http://www.pwn2own.com/\">Pwn2Own</a> reward for bugs specific to Tor Browser in a semi-hardened configuration. We are very interested in this idea and would love to talk with anyone willing to sponsor us in this competition, but we're not yet certain that our hardening options will have stabilized with enough lead time for the 2015 contest next March.<br />\n <br>\n<li><b>Test and recommend the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit on Windows</b></li>\n<p> <br>The <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2458544\">Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit</a> is an optional toolkit that Windows users can run to further harden Tor Browser against exploitation. We've created <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12820\">bug #12820</a> for this analysis.<br />\n <br>\n<li><b>Replace the Firefox memory allocator (jemalloc) with ctmalloc/PartitionAlloc</b></li>\n<p> <br>PartitionAlloc is a memory allocator designed by Google specifically to mitigate common heap-based vulnerabilities by hardening free lists, creating partitioned allocation regions, and using guard pages to protect metadata and partitions. Its basic hardening features can be picked up by using it as a simple malloc replacement library (as ctmalloc). <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10281\">Bug #10281</a> tracks this work.<br />\n <br>\n<li><b>Make use of advanced ParitionAlloc features and other instrumentation to reduce the risk from use-after-free vulnerabilities</b></li>\n<p> <br>The iSEC vulnerability review found that the overwhelming majority of vulnerabilities to date in Firefox were use-after-free, followed closely by general heap corruption. In order to mitigate these vulnerabilities, we would need to make use of the heap partitioning features of PartitionAlloc to actually ensure that allocations are partitioned (for example, by using the existing tags from Firefox's <a href=\"about:memory\">about:memory</a>). We will also investigate enabling assertions in limited areas of the codebase, such as the refcounting system, the JIT and the Javascript engine.\n</ul>\n<h1>Vulnerability Surface Reduction (Security Slider)</h1>\n<p>A large portion of the report was also focused on analyzing historical Firefox vulnerability data and other sources of large vulnerability surface for a planned \"Security Slider\" UI in Tor Browser. </p>\n<p>The Security Slider was first suggested by Roger Dingledine as a way to make it easy for users to trade off between functionality and security, gradually disabling features ranked by both vulnerability count and web prevalence/usability impact. </p>\n<p>The report makes several recommendations along these lines, but a brief distillation can be found on the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9387#comment:43\">ticket for the slider</a>.</p>\n<p>At a high level, we plan for four levels in this slider. \"Low\" security will be the current Tor Browser settings, with the addition of JIT support. \"Medium-Low\" will disable most of the JIT, and make HTML5 media click-to-play via NoScript. \"Medium-High\" will disable the rest of the JIT, will disable JS on non-HTTPS url bar origins, and disable SVG. \"High\" will fully disable Javascript, block remote fonts via NoScript, and disable all media codecs except for WebM (which will remain click-to-play).</p>\n<p><a id=\"plans\"></a></p>\n<h1>The Long Term</h1>\n<p>A web browser is a very large and complicated piece of software, and while we believe that the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy\">privacy properties</a> of Tor Browser are better than those of every other web browser currently available, it is very important to us that we raise the bar to successful code execution and exploitation of Tor Browser as well.</p>\n<p>We are very eager to see the deployment of <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox\">sandboxing support in Firefox</a>, which should go a long way to improving the security of Tor Browser as well. To improve security for their users, Mozilla has recently shifted <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/mozilla.dev.platform/e10s/mozilla.dev.platform/q0Ku_8j26Pc/OtHXnNThv0IJ\">10 engineers</a> into the Electrolysis project, which provides the groundwork for producing a multiprocess sandbox architecture for the desktop Firefox. This will allow them to provide a Google Chrome style security sandbox for website content, to reduce the risk from software vulnerabilities, and generally impede exploitability.</p>\n<p>Until that time, we will also be investigating providing <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10599\">hardened builds of Tor Browser</a> using the <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer\">AddressSanitizer</a> and <a href=\"https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/vtv\">Virtual Table Verification</a> features of newer GCC releases. While this will not eliminate all vectors of memory corruption-based exploitation (in particular, the hardening properties of AddressSanitizer are not as good as those provided by <a href=\"www.github.com/santoshn/softboundcets-34/\">SoftBounds+CETS</a> for example, but that compiler is not yet production-ready), it should raise the bar to exploitation. We are hopeful that these builds in combination with PartitionAlloc and the Security Slider will satisfy the needs of our users who require high security and who are willing to trade performance and usability in order to get it.</p>\n<p>We also hope to include optional <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5791\">application-wide sandboxes</a> for Tor Browser as part of the official distribution.</p>\n<p><a id=\"chrome\"></a></p>\n<h1>Why not Google Chrome?</h1>\n<p>It is no secret that in many ways, both we and Mozilla are playing catch-up to reach the level of code execution security provided by Google Chrome, and in fact closely following the Google Chrome security team was one of the recommendations of the iSEC report.</p>\n<p>In particular, Google Chrome benefits from a <a href=\"http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/guts\">multiprocess sandboxing architecture</a>, as well as several further <a href=\"http://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/brag-sheet\">hardening options and innovations</a> (such as PartitionAlloc).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, our budget for the browser project is still very constrained compared to the amount of work that is required to provide the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy\">privacy properties we feel are important</a>, and Firefox remains a far more cost-effective platform for us for several reasons. In particular, Firefox's flexible extension system, fully scriptable UI, solid proxy support, and its long Extended Support Release cycle all allow us to accomplish far more with fewer resources than we could with any other web browser.</p>\n<p>Further, Google Chrome is far less amenable to supporting <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#privacy\">basic web privacy</a> and Tor-critical features (such as solid proxy support) than Mozilla Firefox. <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/google-chrome-incognito-mode-tor-and-fingerprinting\">Initial efforts</a> to work with the Google Chrome team saw some success in terms of adding APIs that are crucial to addons such as HTTPS-Everywhere, but we ran into several roadblocks when it came to Tor-specific features and changes. In particular, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/ImportantGoogleChromeBugs#ProxyBypassBugs\">several bugs required for basic proxy-safe Tor support</a> for Google Chrome's Incognito Mode ended up blocked for various reasons. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=80722\">worst offender</a> on this front is the use of the Microsoft Windows CryptoAPI for certificate validation, without any alternative. This bug means that certificate revocation checking and intermediate certificate retrieval happen outside of the browser's proxy settings, and is subject to alteration by the OEM and/or the enterprise administrator. Worse, beyond the Tor proxy issues, the use of this OS certificate validation API means that the OEM and enterprise also have a simple entry point for installing their own root certificates to enable transparent HTTPS man-in-the-middle, with full browser validation and no user consent or awareness.</p>\n<p>All of this is not to mention the need for defenses against <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#identifier-linkability\">third party tracking</a> and <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#fingerprinting-linkability\">fingerprinting</a> to prevent the linking of Tor activity to non-Tor usage, and which would also be useful for the wider non-Tor userbase.</p>\n<p>While we'd love for this situation to change, and are open to working with Google to improve things, at present it means that our only option for Chrome is to maintain an even more invasive fork than our current Firefox patch set, with much less likelihood of a future merge than with Firefox. As a ballpark estimate, maintaining such a fork would require somewhere between 3 and 5 times the engineering staff and infrastructure we currently have at our disposal, in addition to the ramp-up time to port our current feature set over.</p>\n<p>Unless either our funding situation or Google's attitude towards the features we require changes, Mozilla Firefox will remain the best platform for us to demonstrate that it is in fact possible to provide <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2012/dnt-ws/position-papers/21.pdf\">true privacy by design</a> for the web for those who want it. It is very distressing that this means playing catch-up and forcing our users to make usability tradeoffs in exchange for improved browser security, but we will continue to do what we can to improve that situation, both with Mozilla and with our own independent efforts.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the thirty-third issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the community around Tor, <a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/aphex-twin-deep-web-album-syro/\">Aphex Twin’s favorite anonymity network</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser 3.6.4 and 4.0-alpha-1 are out</h1>\n<p>Erinn Clark took to the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-364-and-40-alpha-1-are-released\">Tor Blog</a> to announce two new releases by the Tor Browser team. The stable version (3.6.4) contains fixes for several new OpenSSL bugs, although since Tor should only be vulnerable to one of them, and “as this issue is only a DoS”, it is not considered a critical security update. This release also brings Tor Browser users the fixes that give log warnings about the RELAY_EARLY traffic confirmation attack explained <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack\">last month</a>. Please be sure to upgrade as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Alongside this stable release, the first alpha version of Tor Browser 4.0 is now available. Among the most exciting new features of this series is the inclusion of the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a> pluggable transport. In contrast to the bridge-based transports already available in Tor Browser, meek relies on a principle of “too big to block”, as its creator David Fifield <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-use-%E2%80%9Cmeek%E2%80%9D-pluggable-transport#comment-70044\">explained</a>: “instead of going through a bridge with a secret address, you go through a known domain (<a href=\"http://www.google.com\" title=\"www.google.com\">www.google.com</a> for example) that the censor will be reluctant to block. You don’t need to look up any bridge addresses before you get started”. meek currently supports two “front domains”, Google and Amazon Web Services; it may therefore be especially useful for users behind extremely restrictive national or local firewalls. David posted a fuller explanation of meek, and how to configure it, in a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-use-%E2%80%9Cmeek%E2%80%9D-pluggable-transport\">separate blog post</a>.</p>\n<p>This alpha release also “paves the way to [the] upcoming autoupdater by reorganizing the directory structure of the browser”, as Erinn wrote. This means that users upgrading from any previous Tor Browser series cannot extract the new version over their existing Tor Browser folder, or it will not work.</p>\n<p>You can consult the full list of changes and bugfixes for both versions in Erinn’s post, and download the new releases themselves from the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/\">Tor website</a>.</p>\n<h1>The Tor network no longer supports designating relays by name</h1>\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/161d7d1:/src/config/torrc.in#l20\">very first versions of Tor</a>, relay operators have been able to specify “nicknames” for their relays. Such nicknames were initially meant to be unique across the network, and operators of directory authorities would manually “bind” a relay identity key after verifying the nickname. The process became formalized with the “Named” flag introduced in the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/attic/dir-spec-v2.txt#l427\">0.1.1 series</a>, and later automated with the 0.2.0 series. If a relay held a unique nickname for long enough, the authoritywould recognize the binding, and subsequently reserve the name for half a year.</p>\n<p>Nicknames are useful because it appears humans are not very good at thinking using long strings of random bits. Initially, they made it possible to understand what was happening in the network more easily, and to designate a specific relay in an abbreviated way. Having two relays in the network with the same nickname is not really problematic when one is looking at nodes, or a list in <a href=\"https://globe.torproject.org/#/search/query=Unnamed\">Globe</a>, as relays can always be differentiated by their IP addresses or identity keys.</p>\n<p>But complications arise when nicknames are used to specify one relay to the exclusion of another. If the wrong relay gets selected, it can become a security risk. Even though <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/122-unnamed-flag.txt\">real efforts</a> have been made to improve the situation, properly enforcing uniqueness has always been problematic, and a burden for the few directory authorities that handle naming. </p>\n<p>Back in April, the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/openssl-bug-cve-2014-0160\">“Heartbleed” bug</a> forced many relays to switch to a new identity key, thus losing their “Named” flag. Because this meant that anyone designating relays by their nickname would now have a hard time continuing to do so, Sebastian Hahn decided to use the opportunity to <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/235-kill-named-flag.txt\">get rid of the idea entirely</a>.</p>\n<p>This week, Sebastian <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007348.html\">wrote</a>: “Code review down to 0.2.3.x has shown that the naming-related code hasn’t changed much at all, and no issues were found which would mean a Named-flag free consensus would cause any problems. gabelmoo and tor26 have stopped acting as Naming Directory Authorities, and — pending any issues — will stay that way.”</p>\n<p>This means that although you can still give your relay a nickname in its configuration file, designating relays by nickname for any other purpose (such as telling Tor to avoid using certain nodes) has now stopped working.  “If you — in your Tor configuration file — refer to any relay by name and not by identity hash, please change that immediately. Future versions of Tor will not support using names in the configuration at all”, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-August/034380.html\">warns Sebastian</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>meejah <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007375.html\">announced</a> the release of version 0.11.0 of txtorcon, a Twisted-based Python controller library for Tor. This release brings several API improvements; see meejah’s message for full release notes and instructions on how to download it.</p>\n<p>Mike Perry posted an <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/isec-partners-conducts-tor-browser-hardening-study\">overview</a> of a recent report put together by iSEC Partners and commissioned by the Open Technology Fund to explore “current and future hardening options for the Tor Browser”. Among other things, Mike’s post addresses the report’s immediate hardening recommendations, latest thoughts on the proposed Tor Browser “security slider”, and longer-term security development measures, as well as ways in which the development of Google Chrome could inform Tor Browser’s own security engineering.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson asked for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007355.html\">comments</a> on Trunnel, “a little tool to automatically generate binary encoding and parsing code based on C-like structure descriptions” intended to prevent “Heartbleed”-style vulnerabilities from creeping into Tor’s binary-parsing code in C. “My open questions are: Is this a good idea? Is it a good idea to use this in Tor? Are there any tricky bugs left in the generated code? What am I forgetting to think of?”, wrote Nick.</p>\n<p>George Kadianakis followed up his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-June/007042.html\">journey to the core</a> of what Tor does when trying to connect to entry guards in the absence of a network connection with <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007346.html\">another post</a> running through some possible improvements to Tor’s behavior in these situations: “I’m looking forward to some feedback on the proposed algorithms as well as improvements and suggestions”.</p>\n<p>Arturo Filastò <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007353.html\">requested feedback</a> on some proposed changes to the format of the “test deck” used by ooni-probe, the main project of the Open Observatory of Network Interference. “A test deck is basically a way of telling it ‘Run this list of OONI tests with these inputs and by the way be sure you also set these options properly when doing so’…This new format is supposed to overcome some of the limitations of the old design and we hope that a major redesign will not be needed in the near future”, wrote Arturo.</p>\n<p>Tor’s importance to users who are at risk, for a variety of reasons, makes it an attractive target for creators of malware, who distribute fake or modified versions of Tor software for malicious purposes. Following a recent report of a fake Tor Browser in circulation, Julien Voisin carried out an investigation of the compromised software, and posted a <a href=\"http://dustri.org/b/torbundlebrowserorg.html\">detailed analysis</a> of the results. To ensure you are protected against this sort of attack, make sure you <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures\">verify</a> any Tor software you download before running it!</p>\n<p>Arlo Breault submitted a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000622.html\">status report for July</a>.</p>\n<p>As the annual Google Summer of Code season draws to a close, Tor’s GSoC students are submitting their final reports.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the thirty-fourth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Orfox: a new Firefox-based secure browser for Android</h1>\n<p>With the growing popularity of pocket computers (also known as “phones”), users need to have access to censorship-circumvention and anonymity systems on these devices as well as on their desktop or laptop machines. While there is currently no supported implementation of Tor for Apple’s iOS, the <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info\">Guardian Project</a> works closely with the Tor Project to produce (amongst other software) a Tor client for Android named <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/\">Orbot</a>. Mobile applications can be proxied through Orbot just as they can through the Tor client on other operating systems, but mobile web browsing potentially suffers from the same issues that the Tor Browser was designed to protect against, such as disk leaks and a large attack surface. The Guardian Project has therefore also been maintaining a dedicated mobile browser for use with Orbot under the name <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/apps/orweb/\">Orweb</a>.</p>\n<p>Orweb is based on WebView, and is limited by that browser’s features; flaws such as the <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/2014/06/30/recent-news-on-orweb-flaws/\">potential HTML5 IP leak</a>, while possible to work around in the short term, have made it clear that the best future for secure mobile browsing lies in a switch to an application based on Firefox/Fennec/GeckoView.</p>\n<p>Following a successful Google Summer of Code project by <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-August/007379.html\">Amogh Pradeep</a> and work by other Guardian Project members, Nathan Freitas <a href=\"https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-August/003717.html\">announced</a> that “a real working version” of Orfox, the new Orbot-compatible mobile browser, is now available. “All the necessary defaults [have been] changed to match Tor Browser’s defaults as closely as possible”; the developers also “remove the Android permissions for things like camera, mic, GPS” and “turn off webrtc.”</p>\n<p>“We still need to figure out which preferences and features map between the desktop mobile browser and the Android version, so there is quite a bit of work to do”, but you can download and test this initial version by following the links in Nathan’s email. “Over the next few months we hope to launch this as our new official browser for Orbot, and deprecate Orweb as quickly as possible”, he concluded.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>A new release of ooniprobe, the network interference data collector for <a href=\"https://ooni.torproject.org/\">OONI</a>, was <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/ooni-dev/2014-August/000147.html\">announced</a> by Arturo Filastò. Version 1.1.0 introduces a new command line tool “for listing the reports that have not been published to a collector and that allows the probe operator to choose which ones they would like to upload”.

    "content": "<p>Looking for a way to help the Internet stay open and free? This topic needs some dedicated people to give it more attention &mdash; it could easily grow to as large a project as Tor itself. In the short term, OTF's <a href=\"https://www.opentechfund.org/labs/fellowships\">Information Controls Fellowship Program</a> has expressed interest in funding somebody to get this project going, and EFF's Eva Galperin has said she'd be happy to manage the person as an OTF fellow at EFF, with mentorship from Tor people. The first round of those proposals has a deadline in a few days, but if that timeframe doesn't work for you, this problem isn't going away: let us know and we can work with you to help you coordinate other funding.</p>\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n<p>We used to think there are two main ways that the Tor network can fail. First, legal or policy pressure can make it so nobody is willing to run a relay. Second, pressure on or from Internet Service Providers can reduce the number of places willing to host exit relays, which in turn squeezes down the anonymity that the network can provide.  Both of these threats are hard to solve, but they are challenges that we've known about for a decade, and due in large part to strong ongoing collaborations we have a pretty good handle on them.</p>\n<p>We missed a third threat to Tor's success: a growing number of websites treat users from anonymity services differently. Slashdot doesn't let you post comments over Tor, Wikipedia won't let you edit over Tor, and Google sometimes gives you a captcha when you try to search (depending on what other activity they've seen from that exit relay lately). Some sites like Yelp go further and refuse to even serve pages to Tor users.</p>\n<p>The result is that the Internet as we know it is siloing. Each website operator works by itself to figure out how to handle anonymous users, and generally neither side is happy with the solution. The problem isn't limited to just Tor users, since these websites face basically the same issue with users from open proxies, users from AOL, users from Africa, etc. </p>\n<p>Two recent trends make the problem more urgent. First, sites like Cloudflare, Akamai, and Disqus create bottlenecks where their components are used by many websites. This centralization impacts many websites at once when e.g. Cloudflare changes its strategy for how to handle Tor users. Second, services increasingly outsource their blacklisting, such that e.g. Skype refuses connections from IP addresses that run Tor exit relays, not because they worry about abuse via Tor (it's hard to use Skype over Tor), but because their blacklist provider has an incentive to be overbroad in its blocking. (Blacklist providers compete in part by having \"the most complete\" list, and in many cases it's hard for services to notice that they're losing contributions from now-missing users.)</p>\n<p>Technical mechanisms do exist to let anonymous users interact with websites in ways that control abuse better. Simple technical approaches include \"you can read but you can't post\" or \"you have to log in to post\".  More complex approaches track reputation of users and give them access to site features based on past behavior of the user rather than on past behavior of their network address. Several research designs suggest using <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#oakland11-formalizing\">anonymous credentials</a>, where users anonymously receive a cryptographic credential and then prove to the website that they possess a credential that hasn't been blacklisted &mdash; without revealing their credential, so the website can't link them to their past behavior.</p>\n<p>Social mechanisms have also proven effective in some cases, ranging from community moderation (I hear Wikipedia Germany manually approves edits from users who don't have sufficiently reputable accounts), to flagging behavior from Tor users (even though you don't know *which* Tor user it is) so other participants can choose how to interact with them.</p>\n<p>But applying these approaches to real-world websites has not gone well overall. Part of the challenge is that the success stories are not well-publicized, so each website feels like it's dealing with the question in isolation. Some sites do in fact face quite different problems, which require different solutions: Wikipedia doesn't want jerks to change the content of pages, whereas Yelp doesn't want competitors to scrape all its pages. We can also imagine that some companies, like ones that get their revenue from targeted advertising, are fundamentally uninterested in allowing anonymous users at all.</p>\n<h2>A way forward</h2>\n<p>The solution I envision is to get a person who is both technical and good at activism to focus on this topic. Step one is to enumerate the set of websites and other Internet services that handle Tor connections differently from normal connections, and look for patterns that help us identify the common (centralized) services that impact many sites.  At the same time, we should make a list of solutions &mdash; technical and social &mdash; that are in use today. There are a few community-led starts on the Tor wiki already, like <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/projects/DontBlockMe\">the DontBlockMe page</a> and a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/doc/ListOfServicesBlockingTor\">List of Services Blocking Tor</a>.</p>\n<p>Step two is to sort the problem websites based on how amenable they would be to our help. Armed with the toolkit of options we found in step one, we should go to the first (most promising) site on the list and work with them to understand their problem. Ideally we can adapt one of the ideas from the toolkit; otherwise we'll need to invent and develop a new approach tailored to their situation and needs. Then we should go to the second site on the list with our (now bigger) toolkit, and so on down the list. Once we have some success stories, we can consider how to scale better, such as holding a conference where we invite the five best success cases plus the next five unsolved sites on our list.</p>\n<p>A lot of the work will be building and maintaining social connections with engineers at the services, to help them understand what's possible and to track regressions (for example, every year or so Google gets a new engineer in charge of deciding when to give out Captchas, and they seem to have no institutional memory of how the previous one decided to handle Tor users). It might be that the centralization of Cloudflare et al can be turned around into an advantage, where making sure they have a good practices will scale to help many websites at once.</p>\n<p>EFF is the perfect organization to lead this charge, given its community connections, its campaigns like <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2014\">Who has your back?</a>, and its more (at least more than Tor ;) neutral perspective on the topic. And now, when everybody is sympathetic about the topic of surveillance, is a great time to try to take back some ground. We have a wide variety of people who want to help, from scientists and research groups who would help with technical solutions if only they understood the real problems these sites face, to users and activists who can help publicize both the successful cases and the not-yet-successful cases.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to the future, I'm also part of an upcoming research collaboration with Dan Boneh, Andrea Forte, Rachel Greenstadt, Ryan Henry, Benjamin Mako Hill, and Dan Wallach who will look both at the technical side of the problem (building more useful ideas for the toolkit) and also the social side of the problem: how can we quantify the loss to Wikipedia, and to society at large, from turning away anonymous contributors?  Wikipedians say \"we have to blacklist all these IP addresses because of trolls\" and \"Wikipedia is rotting because nobody wants to edit it anymore\" in the same breath, and we believe these points are related. The group is at the \"applying for an NSF grant\" stage currently, so it will be a year or more before funding appears, but I mention it because we should get somebody to get the ball rolling now, and hopefully we can expect reinforcements to appear as momentum builds.</p>\n<p>In summary, if this call to arms catches your eye, your next steps are to think about what you most want to work on to get started, and how you would go about doing it. You can apply for an OTF fellowship, or we can probably help you find other funding sources as needed too.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the thirty-fifth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what is happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser 3.6.5 and 4.0-alpha-2 are out</h1>\n<p>The Tor Browser team put out two new releases of the privacy-preserving web browser. Among the major changes, version 3.6.5 upgrades Firefox to 24.8.0esr, and includes an improved prompt to help users defend against <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-July/033969.html\">HTML5 canvas image fingerprinting</a>, following a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/12684\">patch</a> by Isis Lovecruft. Version 4.0-alpha-2 additionally includes the code for the forthcoming Tor Browser auto-updater (switched off by default) and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-qa/2014-September/000458.html\">“better hardening for Windows and Linux builds”</a>.</p>\n<p>As ever, you can download the new releases along with their signature files from the Tor Project’s <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/\">distribution directory</a>. Please upgrade as soon as you can.</p>\n<h1>Tails 1.1.1 is out</h1>\n<p>The Tails team <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.1.1/\">released</a> version 1.1.1 of the Debian- and Tor-based live operating system. As well as upgrading key components like Tor, Iceweasel, and Linux, this release disables I2P by default when Tails is booted, in response to the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/security/Security_hole_in_I2P_0.9.13/\">vulnerability recently disclosed by Exodus Intelligence</a>. Like Truecrypt, “i2p” must now be specified as a parameter on booting by users who wish to use it.</p>\n<p>A number of other security fixes and routine improvements make this an important update for all Tails users. See the full changelog in the team’s announcement, then update from a running copy of Tails 1.1 if you have one, or head to the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/download/\">download page</a> if you don’t.</p>\n<h1>Helping Internet services accept anonymous users</h1>\n<p>Without a large and diverse network, run by thousands of dedicated volunteers, Tor would be nowhere near as useful or popular as it currently is. Although the current situation might at times seem fragile, there are still many places where it is feasible to host Tor exit nodes.</p>\n<p>However, Tor would become much less attractive to users if they found themselves unable to reach or interact with their favorite websites while using it, a situation that is unfortunately growing more common as site administrators and engineers react negatively to instances of abusive Tor traffic by banning anonymous connections outright. Tor users and developers, as well as members of other online communities (such as <a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:IdeaLab/Partnership_between_Wikimedia_community_and_Tor_community\">Wikimedia</a>), have tried to address the issue before, but real progress has yet to be made.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine wrote a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/call-arms-helping-internet-services-accept-anonymous-users\">“call to arms”</a> explaining the problem in detail and exploring possible paths to a solution: “Step one is to enumerate the set of websites and other Internet services that handle Tor connections differently from normal connections […]. Step two is to sort the problem websites based on how amenable they would be to our help”.</p>\n<p>Since the problem involves humans as much as it does machines, anyone working on it will have to be both “technical” but also ”good at activism”. If you fit that description, OTF has expressed interest in funding work on this issue through their <a href=\"https://www.opentechfund.org/labs/fellowships\">Information Controls Fellowship Program</a>. Please read Roger’s blog post in full for more details.</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for August 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of August has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000626.html\">Damian Johnson</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-August/000627.html\">Georg Koppen</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000628.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000629.html\">Noel Torres</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000630.html\">Kevin P Dyer</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000633.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000635.html\">Lunar</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000636.html\">Arthur D.

It also restores the missing RELRO hardening option to the Linux bundles, and disables NTLM and Negotiate HTTP auth (which can leak sensitive information about the computer). To avoid resolution fingerprinting, popups are also opened in new tabs by default.</p>\n<p>Here is the complete changelog for 3.6.5:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All Platforms\n<ul>\n<li>Update Firefox to 24.8.0esr\n<li>Update NoScript to 2.6.8.39\n<li>Update HTTPS Everywhere to 4.0.0\n<li>Update Torbutton to 1.6.12.1\n<ul>\n<li>Bug 12684: New strings for canvas image extraction message\n<li>Bug 8940: Move RecommendedTBBVersions file to <a href=\"http://www.torproject.org\" title=\"www.torproject.org\">www.torproject.org</a>\n<li>Bug 9531: Workaround to avoid rare hangs during New Identity\n   </ul>\n<li>Bug 12684: Improve Canvas image extraction permissions prompt\n<li>Bug 7265: Only prompt for first party canvas access.

This means that if all goes well, 4.0-alpha-2 users will notified of an available update via a notification similar to that in Firefox. You will then be able to download and install it directly via the browser UI. By default, neither the download nor the update will happen automatically, so if you are not feeling adventurous, you need not allow it to update in this way. Even if you are feeling adventurous, you should probably back up your Tor Browser directory before updating.</p>\n<p>In addition to the updater, this release should also re-enable the basic hardening features on Windows, including ASLR, DEP, and SSP.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the NoScript behavior in this release has changed. Selecting \"Temporarily allow scripts\" will now automatically allow all scripts in a page. This was done for usability reasons, to make it easier for novice users to run Tor Browser with scripting disabled most of the time. This will also hopefully make it possible for more people to use the \"High Security\" setting in our upcoming <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9387\">Security Slider</a>, which will have Javascript disabled globally via NoScript by default.</p>\n<p>Here is the complete changelog for 4.0-alpha-2:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All Platforms\n<ul>\n<li>Update Firefox to 24.8.0esr\n<li>Update NoScript to 2.6.8.39\n<li>Update Tor Launcher to 0.2.7.0\n<ul>\n<li>Bug 11405: Remove firewall prompt from wizard.\n<li>Bug 12895: Mention @riseup.net as a valid bridge request email address\n<li>Bug 12444: Provide feedback when “Copy Tor Log” is clicked.\n<li>Bug 11199: Improve error messages if Tor exits unexpectedly\n   </ul>\n<li>Update Torbutton to 1.6.12.1\n<ul>\n<li>Bug 12684: New strings for canvas image extraction message\n<li>Bug 8940: Move RecommendedTBBVersions file to <a href=\"http://www.torproject.org\" title=\"www.torproject.org\">www.torproject.org</a>\n   </ul>\n<li>Bug 12684: Improve Canvas image extraction permissions prompt\n<li>Bug 7265: Only prompt for first party canvas access.

    "content": "<p>\nThe Google Summer of Code (GSoC) was an excellent opportunity to improve on the Ahmia search engine. With Google's stipend and friendly mentoring from The Tor Project, I was able to concentrate on development of my search engine project. Thank you all!\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/gsoc\">GSoC 2014</a> is over, but I am sticking around to continue developing and maintaining Ahmia.</p>\n<p>\nHere is the current status of ahmia after GSoC development:\n</p>\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Ahmia is <a href=\"https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/\">open-source search engine software</a> for Tor hidden service websites. You can test the running search engine at <a href=\"https://ahmia.fi/search/\">ahmia.fi</a>.</p>\n<p>Building a search engine for anonymous web sites running inside the Tor network is an interesting problem. Tor enables web servers to <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services\">hide their location</a> and Tor users can connect to these authenticated hidden services while the server and the user both stay anonymous. However, finding web content is hard without a good search engine and therefore a search engine is needed for the Tor network.</p>\n<p>Web search engines are needed to navigate and search the web. There were no search engines for searching hidden service web content, so I decided to build a search engine specially for Tor. I registered ahmia.fi and started development on it as a side project in 2010.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis development involved programming and testing web crawlers, thinking of ways to find hidden service addresses (since the protocol does not allow enumeration), learning about the Tor community, and implementing a filtering policy. Moreover, I implemented <a href=\"https://ahmia.fi/documentation/\">an API</a> that empowers other Tor services that publish content to integrate with Ahmia.</p>\n<p>As a result, Ahmia is a working search engine that indexes, searches and catalogs content published on Tor Hidden Services. Furthermore, it is an environment to share meaningful statistics, insights and news about the Tor network itself.</p>\n<h2>Interesting Summer of Code</h2>\n<p>One of my best memories from the summer is the Tor Project's Summer 2014 Developers meeting that was hosted by Mozilla in Paris, France. I have always admired the people who are working on the Tor Project.</p>\n<p>I also loved the coding itself. Finally I had time to improve the Ahmia search engine and its many features. <a href=\"https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/commits/master\">I did a lot of work</a> and liked it.</p>\n<p>Some journalist were very interested in my work: Carola Frediani asked if I could analyze the content of hidden services. I coded a script that fetches every front page's HTML, I gathered all the keywords, headers and description texts and made a simple word cloud visualization.</p>\n<p><img style=\"width: 530px;\" src=\"https://ahmia.fi/static/visuals/content.png\" alt=\"Hidden website content visualization.\" /></p>\n<p>It is a simple way to glance what is published on the hidden websites.</p>\n<p>Carola found this data useful and used it in her presentation at <a href=\"http://www.sotn.it\" title=\"www.sotn.it\">www.sotn.it</a> on June 11th.</p>\n<h2>Technical design of ahmia</h2>\n<p>The Ahmia web service is written using the Django web framework. As a result, the server-side language is Python. On the client-side, most of the pages are plain HTML. There are some pages that require JavaScript, but the search itself works without client-side JavaScript.</p>\n<p>The components of Ahmia are:</p>\n<ul class=\"task-list\">\n<li>Django front-end site</li>\n<li>PostgreSQL database for the site</li>\n<li>Custom scripts to download data about hidden services</li>\n<li>Django-Haystack connection to Solr database</li>\n<li>Apache Solr for the crawled data</li>\n<li>OnionBot crawler that gathers data to Solr database</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/master/technical_architecture.png\" alt=\"Technical architecture.\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/blob/master/README.md\">See installation and developing tutorial</a></p>\n<h2>Search</h2>\n<p>The full-text search is implemented using Django-Haystack. The search is using crawled website data that is saved to Apache Solr.</p>\n<h2>OnionDir</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://ahmia.fi/address/\">OnionDir</a> is a list of known online hidden service addresses. A separate script gathers this list and fetches information fields from the HTML (title, keywords, description etc.). Furthermore, users can freely edit these fields.</p>\n<p>We've also started a convention where hidden service admins can add a file to their website, called <a href=\"https://ahmia.fi/documentation/descriptionProposal/\">description.json</a>, to offer an official description of their site in Ahmia.</p>\n<p>As a result, this information is shown in <a href=\"https://ahmia.fi/address/#/search=Description%20downloaded%20directly%20from%20the%20hidden%20service.\">the OnionDir page</a> and over 80 domains are already using this method.</p>\n<h2>Statistics</h2>\n<p>We are gathering statistics from hidden services. As a result, we can represent and share <a href=\"https://ahmia.fi/documentation/\">meaningful data about hidden services</a> and <a href=\"https://ahmia.fi/stats/viewer\">visualize it</a>.</p>\n<p>We are gathering three types of popularity data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tor2web nodes share their visiting statistics to Ahmia</li>\n<li>Number of public WWW backlinks to hidden services</li>\n<li>Number of clicks in the search results</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The click counter tells the total number of clicks on a search result in ahmia.fi</p>\n<h2>Filtering</h2>\n<p>We have decided to filter any sites related to child porn from our search results. Ahmia is removing everything related to these websites. These websites may not be actual child porn sites. They are rather sites where users can post content (forums, file and image uploads etc.) and as the result there have been, momentarily at least, some suspicious content that has not been moderated in a reasonable period of time. Ahmia.fi does not have the time to monitor these sites carefully and we are banning sites from our public index if we see any evidence of child abuse. Of course, the ban is removed if the site itself contacts us and we review the website to be OK.</p>\n<p>In practice, Ahmia calculates the MD5 sums of the banned domains for use as a filtering policy. Moreover, we are sharing this list and Tor2web nodes can use the list to filter out pages.</p>\n<p>At the moment, there seems to be 1228 hidden website domains online and 7 of them has been filtered because they are possibly sharing child porn content.</p>\n<h2>OnionBot</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/tree/master/onionbot\">OnionBot</a> is a crawler for hidden service websites based on the Scrapy framework. It crawls the Tor network and passes data to the search database. OnionBot requires the Tor software (using Tor2web mode) and Polipo. The results are saved to Apache Solr.</p>\n<h2>Apache Solr</h2>\n<p>Apache Solr is a popular, open source enterprise search platform. Its major features include powerful full-text search, hit highlighting, faceted search, and near real-time indexing.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/blob/master/solr/schema.xml\">schema.xml</a> file contains all of the details about which fields your documents can contain, and how those fields should be dealt with when adding documents to the index, or when querying those fields.</p>\n<h2>Security measures for privacy</h2>\n<p>In the software</p>\n<ul class=\"task-list\">\n<li>We do not log any IP addresses, see <a href=\"https://github.com/juhanurmi/ahmia/tree/master/apache2\">Apache configuration</a>\n</li>\n<li>We are gathering real-time clicks, however, this data is not shown accurately</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the host ahmia.fi</p>\n<ul class=\"task-list\">\n<li>Backend servers are run separately and they do not have any knowledge about the end-users</li>\n<li>All servers are hosted in countries with strong privacy laws. For example, Finland and the Netherlands</li>\n<li>Communication between servers is encrypted</li>\n<li>Only a few trustworthy people know the locations of the back-end servers and are able to access them</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Future work</h2>\n<p>GSoC 2014 was fun and productive!</p>\n<p>There is a lot more to do. However, I do not have time to do everything myself. Of course, I am coding when I have time and maintaining the search engine.</p>\n<p>In addition, I am going to write a scientific article about the implementation.</p>\n<p>Is there anyone who would be interested in developing Ahmia.fi?</p>\n<p>Is anyone familiar with Solr and would know how to tweak it for full text search?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, any kind of help would be most welcome. There are always Linux admin duties, HTML/CSS design, bug fixing, Django development, etc...</p>\n<p><b>For further information, please don't hesitate to contact me by e-mail: juha.nurmi@ahmia.fi</b></p>"

This means that the Tor Browser team would only have to distribute standard-sized 64-bit builds for Mac OS X rather than the oversized 32+64-bit set. Users who are unable to upgrade their operating system would still be able to use Tails for their Tor browsing needs.</p>\n<p>Hartmut Haase <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034666.html\">reported</a> that Tor Browser occasionally fails to open, despite a successful connection being made to the Tor network; several other users confirmed that they are also experiencing this problem. Georg Koppen <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034678.html\">suggested</a> that the issue is the one covered by <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10804\">bug ticket #10804</a>: “Solving this is high on the priority list, but alas not as high as getting everything ready for the switch to ESR31.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-September/000681.html\">Peter Ludikovsky</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-September/000685.html\">goll</a> for running mirrors of the Tor Project website and software archive!</p>\n<p>Andrew Lewman <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-September/000690.html\">published</a> the results of a test he ran to answer the question “Why not just use CloudFlare for mirrors of the Tor Project website?”: “The results are that using CloudFlare doesn’t offload the binaries, which are what make up the bulk of traffic on the mirror […] I’ve started to look at CDN providers to see if there are affordable services which can offload the entire site itself.”</p>\n<p>As part of an ongoing effort to rescue the Tor blog from rot and ruin caused by broken Drupal code, ultrasandwich <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10022#comment:22\">set up</a> an <a href=\"http://tor-blog.deadhare.com/\">unofficial preview</a> of a possible blog based on the Jekyll static site generator. If you want to contribute to the revamp of the Tor Project website, including the blog, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/www-team\">www-team mailing list</a> awaits your comments and ideas!</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Users want to know if their personal information is safe when they use Tor Browser. Personal accounts are no less secure using Tor Browser than they are using the web without Tor: the problem of authenticating websites and preventing eavesdropping has been addressed outside of the Tor context through HTTPS. That’s why the Tor Browser ships with the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\">HTTPS-Everywhere browser extension</a> — for every website you visit, HTTPS-Everywhere checks  whether or not that website is known to have an HTTPS version, and if so  it connects to the site using HTTPS instead of HTTP. Tor + HTTPS provides  full end-to-end encryption when visiting any site that offers its content  via HTTPS. Using HTTPS with Tor helps keep users’ web accounts secure.</p>\n<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>\n<p>If a single human or organization runs more than one relay, they should configure all their relays to be in the same “family”, the goal being to prevent clients from using more than one of these relays in the same circuit. However, the config option used for this, MyFamily, only accepts relay fingerprints that are preceeded by $, unlike most other config options. It would be great if this option accepted fingerprints preceeded by $, as well as without it. Nick Mathewson says this ticket would be pretty easy, so why not give it a try? It does sound like some fun C hacking. Be sure to post your patch to the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/12093\">ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>Back in the day, the tor daemon, which is the core of the Tor network, compiled and ran on Windows 98. But that’s history, and aren’t we all glad? Somebody should identify and drop support code for all Windows versions prior to Windows XP. Nick says “this is mainly going to be a matter of identifying cases where we use LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress to find always-present-functions in always-present DLLs.” If the previous sentence made any sense to you, maybe you’re a good person to help with this! Be sure to comment on the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11444\">ticket</a> if you have a branch to review.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by harmony, Matt Pagan, Karsten Loesing, and Lunar.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the thirty-seventh issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the community around Tor, the anonymity network that makes full use of its library card.</p>\n<h1>tor 0.2.5.7-rc is out</h1>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034740.html\">announced</a> the first release candidate in tor’s 0.2.5.x series. This version “fixes several regressions from earlier in the 0.2.5.x release series, and some long-standing bugs related to ORPort reachability testing and failure to send CREATE cells”; relay operators running it will also receive a warning if they try to configure a hidden service on the same process as their relay, as the public nature of much information about Tor relays <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/12908#comment:5\">can help identify services running on the same machine</a>. As ever, you can read the full list of improvements and fixes in Nick’s announcement, and download the source code from the Tor Project’s <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">distribution directory</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor protects library patrons’ right to privacy</h1>\n<p>April Glaser and Alison Macrina <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2014/09/13/radical-librarianship-how-nin.html\">published</a> an article for BoingBoing on efforts by Massachusetts librarians to guarantee their patrons’ right to access information without fear of surveillance or censorship. Macrina and her colleagues, in partnership with the ACLU of Massachusetts, have been giving workshops on the use of privacy-preserving technologies to other librarians, and spreading the word about the risk that pervasive surveillance poses to freedom of thought and intellectual inquiry.</p>\n<p>As the authors remark, “it’s no secret that libraries are among our most democratic institutions. Libraries provide access to information and protect patrons’ right to explore new ideas, no matter how controversial or subversive […] and protecting unfettered access to information is important whether that research is done using physical books or online search engines. But now it has become common knowledge that governments and corporations are tracking our digital lives, and that surveillance means our right to freely research information is in jeopardy”.</p>\n<p>Tor and Tails are a natural fit for any response to this problem, and BoingBoing reports that not only have “multiple Massachusetts libraries […] installed the Tor browser on all of their public PCs” following the workshops, some have even “set up Tor middle relays on their libraries’ networks”.</p>\n<p>It would be a shame, however, if these exciting developments were restricted to the state of Massachusetts. If you are a library user concerned about this issue, share the article with your local librarians. If you work in a library, contact the authors of the article at the addresses they provide to find out how you can offer privacy workshops and tools to your own community!</p>\n<h1>Hidden service enumeration and how to prevent it</h1>\n<p>When a Tor user wants to connect to a hidden service, their client makes a request over the Tor network to a relay acting as a “hidden service directory”, or HSDir. In return, the client receives a hidden service “descriptor” containing the information necessary for a connection to be made, including the set of <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services\">Introduction Points</a> that the hidden service is currently using.</p>\n<p>Hidden services would ideally not be discoverable unless the address is public or has been shared directly, but one of the weaknesses of the current protocol is that hidden service directories know which services they are serving descriptors for; this same shortcoming was an element of the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack\">“RELAY_EARLY” traffic confirmation attack</a> discovered in July. Although the full set of descriptors is not published to all directories at once — at any given time, <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/rend-spec.txt#l496\">six directories</a> are responsible for a service’s descriptor — the list is rotated frequently, so it would not be hard for an adversary to run a relay stable enough to gain the HSDir flag, and harvest hidden service addresses as they are uploaded to it in turn.</p>\n<p>Fabio Pietrosanti <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034751.html\">informed</a> the tor-talk mailing list of an experiment designed to detect this enumeration of hidden services: he set up thirty new hidden services, keeping their addresses secret, with each service running a script to report any attempts at access from outside. As the existence of these services was not disclosed to anyone, any requests to the service could only come from a client that had obtained the address from a directory which had previously held the descriptor, possibly “a malicious Tor relay acting as a TorHS directory, with Tor’s code modified to dump from the RAM memory the TorHS list, then harvest them with an http client/script/crawler”. After approximately a month, according to Fabio’s message, a client did indeed try to access one of the “honeypot” services.</p>\n<p>Regular readers of Tor Weekly News will <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-news/2013-December/000023.html\">know</a> that the hidden service protocol is being fully redesigned, and this “next-generation” proposal already suggests <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt#l571\">defenses against this kind of attack</a>, but (as ever) more eyes are needed. If you’re interested, see George Kadianakis’ introduction to the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love\">issues facing hidden services</a>; those familiar with cryptography in C are welcome to review the discussion of this particular issue on the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/8106\">bug tracker</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Nathan Freitas <a href=\"https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2014-September/003773.html\">announced</a> version 14.0.8.1 of Orbot, the Tor client for Android. The highlights of this release are an upgrade to tor 0.2.5.7-rc (see above), which solves an issue with the “airplane mode” feature, as well as a number of improvements to do with transparent proxying. Find the full changelog and download links in Nathan’s message.</p>\n<p>Juha Nurmi <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ahmia-search-after-gsoc-development\">described</a> the current state of ahmia.fi, the search engine for hidden services, following a successful Google Summer of Code project. The post includes notes on the design, content statistics, and plans for future work.</p>\n<p>David Fifield called for a volunteer operating a “<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007482.html\">big fast bridge</a>” to take over the running of the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a> pluggable transport: “I want to do this both to diffuse trust, so that I don’t run all the infrastructure, and because my bridge is not especially fast and I’m not especially adept at performance tuning”.</p>\n<p>David also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007481.html\">wondered</a> why the number of FTE users appeared to dip in late August, and explored possible reasons behind the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007480.html\">correlation in usage statistics</a> for meek and Flashproxy, whose backends both run on the same bridge. Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007483.html\">suggested</a> that the latter was because “we’re counting consensuses downloaded from a bridge via any supported transport, and then we’re attributing those downloads to specific transports based on what fraction of IPs connected per transport”.</p>\n<p>Tim <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007471.html\">reported</a> on progress made towards a “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing\">fuzzer</a>” for Tor, based on the Tor research framework previously <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007232.html\">announced</a> by Gareth Owen, including a draft design for the process and a list of patches against Tor made during development.</p>\n<p>Matt Pagan submitted his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000650.html\">status report</a> for August, while Roger Dingledine sent out the report for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-September/000649.html\">SponsorF</a>.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007469.html\">posted</a> the minutes of last week’s Globe/Atlas developer IRC meeting.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by harmony, Lunar, Roger Dingledine, George Kadianakis, and special.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the thirty-eighth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>The EFF concludes its 2014 Tor Challenge</h1>\n<p>As Tor Weekly News <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-news/2014-June/000049.html\">reported</a> in June, over the last few months the Electronic Frontier Foundation has been holding its second Tor Challenge to improve the strength and diversity of the Tor network by inspiring people to run Tor relays. The 2014 Challenge is now over, and Rainey Reitman of the EFF posted <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/09/tor-challenge-inspires-1635-tor-relays\">some thoughts</a> on the campaign and its outcome.</p>\n<p>1635 Tor relays (including 326 exit relays) were started up or had their capacity increased as part of the 2014 Tor Challenge, compared to 549 at the end of the last campaign in 2011. As Rainey wrote, this number “far exceeded our hopes”; the success can be attributed to a coordinated promotional effort by the EFF, the Free Software Foundation, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, and the Tor Project, as well as to “the 1,000 individuals who cared enough to help contribute bandwidth to the Tor network.” Thanks to everyone who participated!</p>\n<p>It’s important to remember, though, that new relays only benefit Tor users as long as they stay running. Advice and support from experienced relay operators can always be found on the #tor IRC channel or the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-relays\">tor-relays mailing list</a>; if you missed out on the Tor Challenge this year but still want to contribute to a stronger, more stable Tor network, take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-relay\">Tor website</a> for advice on how to get started.</p>\n<h1>Guardiness and Tor’s directory authorities</h1>\n<p>When a Tor relay is first assigned the Guard flag by the directory authorities (or “dirauths”) it sees a dip in the amount of traffic passing through it, because Guard capacity is a scarce resource on the Tor network and, as Roger Dingledine explained <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/lifecycle-of-a-new-relay\">last year</a>, “all the rest of the clients back off from using you for their middle hops, because when they see the Guard flag, they assume that you have plenty of load already from clients using you as their first hop”, an assumption which is only correct after clients have had enough opportunity to select the new guard. With the recent move to single entry guards, an even longer period of time may pass before a young guard can be selected as a first hop by old clients.</p>\n<p>“Guardiness”, or GuardFraction, is a <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/236-single-guard-node.txt#l101\">proposed measurement</a> to let dirauths, and therefore clients, work out how much of a relay’s capacity is being used for first hops by clients, and how much for second and third hops, by finding the fraction of recent consensuses in which the relay has been given the Guard flag; the “dead period” following the assignment of the flag can then be avoided. George Kadianakis <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007489.html\">published</a> an analysis of ways in which dirauths’ votes could be extended to include this guardiness measurement, taking into account the time and effort required to parse large numbers of Tor consensuses very quickly. The initial proposal was to ask dirauths to run a script each hour that would extract the data required for parsing into “summary files”: Sebastian Hahn <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007526.html\">asked</a> how this measure might fail in different situations, and Peter Palfrader <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007490.html\">suggested</a> that loading every consensus into a database for later querying might be more efficient.</p>\n<p>“This feature is by far the trickiest part of prop236 (guard node security) and I wanted to inform all dirauths of our plan and ask for feedback on the deployment procedure”, wrote George. If you have any comments to add to the discussion so far, please send them to the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-dev\">tor-dev mailing list</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>The Tails team wants to make sure that all the Debian packages on which Tails relies are “in good shape” before Jessie, the next Debian release, is frozen on 5th November. To that end, the team called for testing both of the <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-testers/2014-September/000071.html\">software itself</a> and its <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-l10n/2014-September/001553.html\">translations</a> — if you’d like to help, find full instructions and links to the “barely-working” experimental disk images in the announcements.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a>, the pluggable transport that routes Tor traffic through platforms which are “too big to block”, now works with Microsoft Azure in addition to the already-supported Google App Engine and Amazon Web Services. David Fifield <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007525.html\">posted</a> the announcement, which contains instructions for those who want to start using the new front domain.</p>\n<p>Sebastian Hahn <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034898.html\">announced</a> that gabelmoo, the Tor directory authority which he administers, has moved to a new IP address. “You should not notice any kind of disturbance from this, and everything should continue to work as normal.”</p>\n<p>Released in December 2013, the SafePlug is a $49 router that promises its users “complete security and anonymity” online by sending all of their traffic through Tor. Annie Edmundson from Princeton University released a <a href=\"https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/annee/security-audit-of-safeplug-tor-in-a-box/\">summary</a> of <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/foci14/foci14-edmundson.pdf\">research presented during FOCI’14</a> in which the authors point out several security problems in the implementation of the SafePlug administration interface, and also highlight other structural issues. “The most crucial problem with a torifying proxy is that it uses a bring-your-own-browser system, as opposed to a hardened browser, and therefore is susceptible to browser-based privacy leaks. This is why it’s better to use the Tor Browser Bundle […]”, wrote Annie.</p>\n<p>The upcoming Tor Messenger is based on <a href=\"http://instantbird.com/\">Instantbird</a>. One key feature that was identified as missing in the latter is support for <a href=\"https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/\">Off-the-Record encryption</a>. After months of discussions and reviews to determine the right programming interface, Arlo Breault got the necessary core <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/rev/e2c85d70fda2\">modifications</a> <a href=\"https://hg.mozilla.org/users/florian_queze.net/purple/rev/6550fcf407f0\">merged</a>.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine wrote up a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorControlPortWalkthrough-HS\">walkthrough</a> of the controller events you might see when accessing Tor hidden services. “In theory the controller events should help you understand how far we got at reaching a hidden service when the connection fails. In practice it’s <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13206\">a bit overwhelming</a>”.</p>\n<p>In the first message posted to the recently-created <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/onionoo-announce\">onionoo-announce mailing list</a>, Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/onionoo-announce/2014/000000.html\">explained</a> a minor improvement that should allow Onionoo clients to determine when they need to be upgraded to a new protocol version.</p>\n<p>Leiah, whose design work has featured on many of Tor’s company publications, <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13117\">posted</a> a mock-up of a possible new look for the Tor blog.</p>\n<p>Patrick Schleizer <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034909.html\">announced</a> the release of version 9 of Whonix, the anonymous operating system based on Tor, Debian, and security-by-isolation.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>The help desk has been asked how to configure a VPN to prevent a website from learning that a user is using Tor. We consider positioning a VPN between one’s exit node and the destination site to be totally unsafe, and not much more anonymous than using a VPN without Tor. By design, Tor <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#HideExits\">allows the destination site to know</a> that a visitor is using Tor. The better solution is to email the website owner and ask them to stop blocking Tor. The longer-term solution is that Tor needs someone willing to coordinate with websites to design <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/call-arms-helping-internet-services-accept-anonymous-users\">engagement solutions</a> that work for Tor users and for big websites.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>Jobiwan has a machine on their network which should act as a SOCKS proxy. When Tor Browser is configured to use this proxy, it complains that <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/4173/88\">Tor is not working in this browser</a>. However, Jobiwan is able to visit hidden services with these settings, and wants to know why this message is printed and if it is safe to use Tor Browser this way. Do you know a good answer to this question? If so, please share your thoughts.</p>\n<p>Andy Smith asks if <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/4050/88\">slow relays are useful</a> for the Tor network. Roya suggests that a large number of slow relays is better than a small number of fast relays, at least anonymity-wise, because this helps to grow diversity in the network and makes it harder for an attacker to deanonymize users. On the other hand, user194 and Relay Operator write that a slow relay does not provide much benefit for the network. They recommend spending a few dollars more to rent a fast virtual server.</p>\n<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>\n<p>The tor daemon has a SafeLogging configuration option that removes all potentially sensitive parts of log messages and replaces them with “[scrubbed]”. However, this option does not cover hidden services operated by the tor daemon. Extending this option involves scanning through some code, but Nick says it could be some interesting code; if you’re up to reading and patching some C code and then reading some (hopefully scrubbed) logs, this ticket may be for you. Be sure to post your branch for review on the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/2743\">ticket</a>.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by harmony, Lunar, qbi, Matt Pagan, Karsten Loesing, Arlo Breault, and Roger Dingledine.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the thirty-ninth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor 0.2.4.24 and 0.2.5.8-rc are out</h1>\n<p>Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034937.html\">announced</a> new releases in both the stable and the alpha branches of the core Tor software. Clients accessing hidden services should experience faster and more robust connections as they will now send the correct rendezvous point address. “They used to send the wrong address, which would still work some of the time because they also sent the identity digest of the rendezvous point, and if the hidden service happened to try connecting to the rendezvous point from a relay that already had a connection open to it, the relay would reuse that connection”. This fix also prevents the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness\">endianness</a> of the client’s system from being leaked to the hidden service.</p>\n<p>The only other changes in these releases are an update of the geoip databases and the location of the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034898.html\">gabelmoo directory authority</a>. As usual, you can download the source code from the Tor <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">distribution directory</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser 3.6.6 and 4.0-alpha-3 are out</h1>\n<p>Mike Perry announced two new releases by the Tor Browser team. <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-366-released\">Tor Browser 3.6.6</a> includes a workaround for the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/10804\">bug</a> that has sometimes been preventing the browser window from opening after an apparently successful connection to the Tor network; it also stops intermediate SSL certificates from being written to disk. In addition to these fixes, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-40-alpha-3-released\">Tor Browser 4.0-alpha-3</a> resolves a number of issues to do with the upcoming Tor Browser updater, including the mistaken upgrade of non-English Tor Browsers to the English-language version. As this bug is only fixed in the new release, users upgrading from 4.0-alpha-2 will still experience this issue during the process. Furthermore, “meek transport users will need to restart their browser a second time after upgrade if they use the in-browser updater. We are still trying to get to the bottom of <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13247\">this issue</a>”, wrote Mike.</p>\n<p>Both releases also include important Firefox security updates, so all users should upgrade as soon as possible. See Mike’s announcements for full details, and get your copy from the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html\">project page</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/\">distribution directory</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tails 1.1.2 is out</h1>\n<p>The second point release in the Tails 1.1.x series was <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.1.2/\">put out</a> by the Tails team, “mainly to fix a serious flaw in the Network Security Services (NSS) library used by Firefox and other products that allows attackers to create forged RSA certificates. Before this release, users on a compromised network could be directed to sites using a fraudulent certificate and mistake them for legitimate sites.”</p>\n<p>Other packages affected by recently-disclosed security flaws and updated in this version include APT, bash, and GnuPG, so all Tails users should make sure to upgrade as soon as possible. If you have a running copy of Tails, you can make use of the incremental upgrades system; otherwise, head to the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/download/index\">download page</a> for more information.</p>\n<h1>obfs4 is ready for general deployment: bridge operators needed!</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports\">Pluggable transports</a>, the circumvention techniques which allow users to access the Tor network from censored areas by disguising the fact that the Tor protocol is being used, are about to take another step forward with the release of obfs4, and Yawning Angel <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-September/005372.html\">sent out</a> a brief discussion of this new protocol.</p>\n<p>obfs4 offers a number of developments over the obfs3 and ScrambleSuit protocols, until now the most sophisticated pluggable transports in use on the Tor network. Like ScrambleSuit, obfs4 improves on obfs3 to “<a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfs4.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/doc/obfs4-spec.txt\">provide resilience against active attackers and to disguise flow signatures</a>”, while a safer and more efficient key-exchange process than ScrambleSuit’s should make it impossible for attackers to launch man-in-the-middle attacks based on the client/bridge shared secret.</p>\n<p>Like its predecessors in the obfsproxy series, obfs4 is a bridge-based transport, meaning that volunteers are needed to operate relays running an implementation of the new protocol before users can take advantage of it. The current implementation, obfs4proxy, is now available to download either as <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfs4.git\">source code</a> or as a package from Debian’s <a href=\"https://packages.debian.org/sid/obfs4proxy\">unstable repositories</a>. Those who want to try browsing over the new protocol can download Yawning’s <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~yawning/volatile/tor-browser-obfs4-20140926/\">experimental Tor Browsers</a>, and if you’re willing to run an obfs4 bridge, please see Yawning’s message for all the relevant details — “questions, comments, and bridges appreciated”!</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Anthony G. Basile <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-September/034950.html\">announced</a> the release of version 20140925 of tor-ramdisk, the micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that maximizes security and privacy. This release includes updates to Tor, BusyBox, OpenSSL, and the Linux kernel.</p>\n<p>As part of the current push to better understand hidden services and their use on the Tor network, Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-September/005352.html\">asked</a> relay operators who are “comfortable compiling Tor from git” and who “want to help investigate what fraction of Tor network load comes from hidden service use” to check out the new hs-stats git branch. This version “will collect per-thirty-minute statistics about number of circuits and number of cells your relay sees that have to do with exiting, with hidden services, with circuits where you're not the final hop, and a fourth none-of-the-above category”, which can then be posted to the appropriate <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13192\">ticket</a> on the bug tracker or sent to Roger directly.</p>\n<p>Yawning Angel <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-September/005344.html\">sent</a> a “friendly reminder” to ScrambleSuit bridge operators, asking them to upgrade to tor-0.2.5.x if they haven’t already: “If you are running a ScrambleSuit bridge with tor-0.2.4.x, it is useless. Users that happen to be served your ScrambleSuit bridge will not be able to connect, because the password is missing”.</p>\n<p>Mike Perry <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-September/005335.html\">asked</a> relay operators, particularly those running exit relays, to contribute information about the “hardware, CPU cores, and uplink” of their servers, and how much these cost per month, in order to “put together some estimates on bounds of the current value and cost of the capacity of the Tor network as it is, and use that to generate some rough guestimates on what it would cost to grow it”.</p>\n<p>In response to the possible integration of Tor as a “private browsing mode” by a major browser vendor, Andrew Lewman <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007533.html\">kicked off</a> a discussion of ways in which the Tor network might be scaled up to accommodate “hundreds of millions” of extra users.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>In Firefox, it is possible to drag a URL from the Navigation Toolbar to the Desktop in order to create a shortcut to a website, and the help desk has been asked why this functionality is disabled in Tor Browser. A Desktop shortcut to a URL, when clicked, would be opened by the operating system’s default browser, not by Tor Browser. Permitting this behavior would open the door to confusion as to whether or not a user was visiting a link over Tor, and would violate the “Proxy Obedience” requirement of the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#proxy-obedience\">Tor Browser design</a>.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>Tor StackExchange has started its <a href=\"https://meta.tor.stackexchange.com/q/221/88\">site self-evaluation</a> for September 2014. <a href=\"http://tor.stackexchange.com/review/site-eval\">Ten questions</a> were selected and you’re asked to review them. Are they good or is there room for improvement? Please have a look at the questions and rate them.</p>\n<p>Jens Kubieziel noted that users mix up the terms <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/4192/88\">Tor, Tor Browser and torbrowser-launcher</a>, so he explained each of them to users of the Q&amp;A page.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by harmony, qbi, Lunar, Matt Pagan, dope457, and Yawning Angel.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN? Please help us create this newsletter. We still need more volunteers to watch the Tor community and report important news. Please see the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorWeeklyNews\">project page</a>, write down your name and subscribe to the team <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/news-team\">mailing list</a> if you want to get involved!</p>"

    "content": "<p>Over the last years, we learned a lot about how the Great Firewall of China <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/knock-knock-knockin-bridges-doors\" rel=\"nofollow\">is</a> <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/gfw/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blocking</a> <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5739v1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tor</a>.  Some questions remained unanswered, however.  Roya, Mueen, Jed, and I just published a <a href=\"http://www.cs.unm.edu/~royaen/gfw/\" rel=\"nofollow\">project</a> which seeks to answer some of these open questions.  Being curious as we are, we tried to find answers to the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the filtering decentralised (i.e., happening in provinces) or centralised (i.e., happening in Internet exchange points (IXP))?</li>\n<li>Are there any temporal patterns in the filtering? Or in other words, are there certain times when people are more likely to be able to connect to Tor?</li>\n<li>Similarly, are there any spatial patterns?  Are folks in some special regions of China able to connect to Tor while others cannot?</li>\n<li>When a computer in China tries to connect to a Tor relay, what part of the TCP handshake is blocked?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It turns out that some of these questions are quite tricky to answer.  For example, to find spatial patterns, we need to be able to measure the connectivity between <em>many</em> Tor relays and <em>many</em> clients in China. However, we are not able to control <em>even a single</em> one of these machines.  So how do we proceed from here?  As so often, side channels come to the rescue!  In particular, we made use of two neat network measurement side channels which are the <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5739v1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">hybrid idle scan</a> and the SYN backlog scan.  The backlog scan is a new side channel we discovered and discuss in our paper.  Equipped with these two powerful techniques, we were able to infer if there is packet loss between relay A and client B even though we cannot control A and B.</p>\n<p>You might notice that our measurement techniques are quite different from most other Internet censorship studies which rely on machines inside the censoring country.  While our techniques give us a lot more geographical coverage, they come at a price which is flexibility; we are limited to measuring Internet filtering on the IP layer.  More sophisticated filtering techniques such as deep packet inspection remain outside our scope.</p>\n<p>Now what we did was to measure the connectivity between several dozen Tor relays and computers in China over four weeks which means that we collected plenty of data points, each of which telling us \"was A able to talk to B at time T?\".  These data points reveal a number of interesting things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It appears that many IP addresses inside the China Education and Research Network (CERNET) are able to connect to at least our Tor relay.</li>\n<li>Apart from the CERNET netblock, the filtering seems to be quite effective despite occasional country-wide downtimes.</li>\n<li>It seems like the filtering is centralised at the IXP level instead of being decentralised at the provincial level.  That makes sense from the censor's point of view because it is cheap, effective, and easy to control.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now what does all of this mean for Tor users?  Our results show that China still has a tight grip on its communication infrastructure, especially on the IP and TCP layer.  That is why our circumvention efforts mostly focus on the application layer (with <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\" rel=\"nofollow\">meek</a> being an exception) and pluggable transport protocols such as <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ScrambleSuit</a> (which is now part of the experimental version of <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-alpha\" rel=\"nofollow\">TorBrowser</a>) and <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfs4.git\" rel=\"nofollow\">obfs4</a> are specifically designed to thwart the firewall's <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/gfw/\" rel=\"nofollow\">active probing attacks</a>.</p>"

I think the current release is pretty good, but as the main dev I’m maybe not that neutral regarding this statement” joked CJ.</p>\n<p>The OONI project has been “developing a test that allows probes in censored countries to test which bridges are blocked and which are not”. George Kadianakis is <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007585.html\">seeking help</a> to create interesting visualization of the resulting data. He shared a sketch about <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~asn/bridget_vis/countries_pts.jpg\">countries and pluggable transports</a> and another one showing <a href=\"https://people.torproject.org/~asn/bridget_vis/tbb_blocked_timeline.jpg\">time before blocks happened</a>.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007580.html\">announced</a> the release of <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/trunnel.git\">Trunnel</a> 1.3. Trunnel is a code generator for binary encoders/decoders. Nick adds: “Some code that it has generated has been merged into the Tor master branch for the 0.2.6 release series, though that code is not yet in active use.“</p>\n<p>David Fifield sent a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007576.html\">summary</a> of the costs incurred by the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a> pluggable transport for the month of September 2014. More details are included in the email, but costs are currently very low: “$3.85 for App Engine, $4.59 for Amazon, $0.00 for Azure”.</p>\n<p>Virgil Griffith <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035076.html\">shared</a> a yet unpublished tech report on Tor growth.  To pick just one finding, the Tor network’s bandwidth has been doubling every 13–14 months so far.</p>\n<p>The Knight Foundation is going to <a href=\"https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/libraries/brief.html\">fund projects</a> for “the future of libraries”. The <a href=\"https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/libraries/submissions/the-library-freedom-project-bringing-privacy-education-and-digital-tools-to-local-communities-through-libraries\">Library Freedom Project</a> wants to teach “librarians about privacy rights, law, and tech tools to protect patrons from dragnet surveillance”. It’s based on their <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2014/09/13/radical-librarianship-how-nin.html\">previous experience</a> promoting Tor and other privacy tools in Massachusetts libraries. Show them support!</p>\n<p>The US National Science Foundation is <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035059.html\">seeking input</a> to lay out a future Privacy Research Strategy. The deadline being October 17th, Roger Dingledine suggests: “if anybody here has partially written ideas that they want to put together into a submission, please do!”</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-October/000713.html\">opi</a> for running a new mirror of the Tor Project’s website and software.</p>\n<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/TheTorProject/ooni-backend\">oonibackend</a> is used by ooni, the <a href=\"https://ooni.torproject.org/\">Open Observatory of Network Interference</a>, to run in the background and perform tasks like discovering addresses of test helpers and performing measurements that require a backend system to talk to. When oonibackend was changed to fix compatibility with Twisted 13.1 it <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13116\">lost its ability to start tor and then drop privileges</a>. Arturo suspects that the correct way of doing this is to place the logic for starting tor inside of preApplication or startService. But from a quick research he suspects that Twisted does not support returning Deferreds in there. He also points to two relevant Twisted tickets (<a href=\"https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/5941\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/6813\">2</a>).

    "content": "<p>Hi!  It's a new month, so that means there's a new attack on TLS.</p>\n<p>This time, the attack is that many clients, when they find a server that doesn't support TLS, will downgrade to the ancient SSLv3.  And SSLv3 is subject to a new padding oracle attack.</p>\n<p>There is a readable summary of the issue at <a href=\"https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/10/14/poodle.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adam Langley's blog</a>; it links to other descriptions of the attack.</p>\n<p>Tor itself is not affected: all released versions for a long time have shipped with TLSv1 enabled, and we have never had a fallback mechanism to SSLv3. Furthermore, Tor does not send the same secret encrypted in the same way in multiple connection attempts, so even if you could make Tor fall back to SSLv3, a padding oracle attack probably wouldn't help very much.</p>\n<p>TorBrowser, on the other hand, is based on Firefox, and has the same protocol downgrade mechanisms as Firefox.  I expect and hope the TorBrowser team will be<br />\nreleasing a new version soon with SSLv3 disabled.  But in the meantime, I think you can disable SSLv3 yourself by changing the value of the \"security.tls.version.min\" preference to \"1\".  (The default value is \"0\".)</p>\n<p>To do that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> Enter \"about:config\" in the URL bar.\n<li> Then you click \"I'll be careful, I promise\".\n<li> Then enter \"security.tls.version.min\" in the preference \"search\"<br />\nfield underneath the URL bar.  (Not the search box next to the URL<br />\nbar.)</p>\n<li> You should see an entry that says \"security.tls.version.min\" under<br />\n\"Preference Name\".  Double-click on it, then enter the value \"1\" and<br />\nclick okay.\n</ol>\n<p>You should now see that the value of \"security.tls.version.min\" is set to one.</p>\n<p>(Note that I am not a Firefox developer or a TorBrowser developer: if you're cautious, you might want to wait until one of them says something here before you try this workaround.  On the other hand, if you believe me, you should probably do this in your regular Firefox as well.)</p>\n<p>Obviously, this isn't a convenient way to do this; if you are uncertain of your ability to do so, waiting for an upgrade might be a good move.  In the meantime, if you have serious security requirements and you cannot disable SSLv3, it might be a good idea to avoid using the Internet for a week or two while this all shakes out.</p>\n<p>Best wishes to other residents of these interesting times.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the forty-first issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Academic research into Tor: four recent studies</h1>\n<p>Major contributions to the development and security of Tor are often made by academic researchers, either in a laboratory setting using network simulators like <a href=\"https://shadow.github.io/\">Shadow</a>, or through measurement and analysis of the live network itself (taking care not to harm the security or anonymity of clients and services). Different aspects of Tor’s networking and security, from path selection to theoretical attacks, have been analysed in three recently-published studies.</p>\n<p>Otto Huhta’s <a href=\"http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/G.Danezis/students/Huhta14-UCL-Msc.pdf\">MSc thesis</a> investigates the possibility that an adversary in control of a non-exit relay could link two or more Tor circuits back to the same client based on nothing more than timing information. As Otto <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007517.html\">explained</a>, “this is mainly the result of the fixed 10 minute circuit lifetime and the fact that the transition to using a new circuit is quite sharp.” With the help of a machine classifier, and the fact that any one client will build its circuits through a fixed set of entry guards, the study suggested that such an adversary “can focus only on circuits built through these specific nodes and quite efficiently determine if two circuits belong to the same user.” There is no suggestion that this knowledge alone poses a serious deanonymization risk to clients; however, wrote Otto, “our goal was not to ultimately break the anonymity of any real user but instead to expose a previously unknown threat so that it can be mitigated before anyone actually devises an attack around it.”</p>\n<p>Steven Murdoch published a <a href=\"http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sjm217/papers/#pub-el14optimising\">paper</a> on the optimization of Tor’s node selection probabilities showing, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007601.html\">in Steven’s words</a>, “that what Tor used to do (distributing traffic to nodes in proportion to their contribution to network capacity) is not the best approach.” Prior to publication of the study, “Tor moved to actively measuring the network performance and manipulating the consensus weights in response to changes. This seems to have ended up with roughly the same outcome. […] However, the disadvantage is that it can only react slowly to changes in network characteristics.”</p>\n<p>Sebastian Urbach <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-October/005434.html\">shared</a> a link to <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.1823v1.pdf\">“Defending Tor from Network Adversaries: A Case Study of Network Path Prediction”</a>, in which the researchers analyze the effect of network features like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_System_%28Internet%29\">autonomous systems</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_exchange_point\">Internet exchanges</a> on the security of Tor’s path selection, finding that “AS and IX path prediction significantly overestimates the threat of vulnerability to such adversaries”, and that “the use of active path measurement, rather than AS path models” would be preferable “in further study of Tor vulnerability to AS- and IX-level adversaries and development of practical defenses.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Philipp Winter took to the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/closer-look-great-firewall-china\">Tor blog</a> to summarize some new findings concerning the the way in which the Chinese state Internet censorship system (the “Great Firewall of China”) acts upon blocked connections, like those trying to reach Tor, as detailed in a recent <a href=\"http://www.cs.unm.edu/~royaen/gfw/\">project</a> to which he contributed. Searching for spatial and temporal patterns in Chinese censorship activity, the researchers found that “many IP addresses inside the China Education and Research Network (CERNET) are able to connect” to Tor in certain instances, while the filtering of other networks — centrally conducted at the level of Internet exchanges — “seems to be quite effective despite occasional country-wide downtimes”.</p>\n<p>Each of these studies is up for discussion on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-dev\">tor-dev mailing list</a>, so feel free to join in there with questions and comments for the researchers!</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Michael Rogers <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007590.html\">submitted</a> patches against tor and jtorctl, making two improvements to the performance of mobile hidden services: one “avoids a problem where we’d try to build introduction circuits immediately, all the circuits would fail, and we’d wait for 5 minutes before trying again”, and the other “[adds] a command to the control protocol to purge any cached state relating to a specified hidden service”.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007605.html\">published</a> a “non-functional” <a href=\"https://kloesing.github.io/metrics-2.0/\">mock-up</a> of a possible redesign for the Tor Metrics portal, with notes on design decisions: “Feedback much appreciated. This is the perfect time to consider your ideas.”</p>\n<p>Jeremy Gillula analyzed data relating to Tor node churn found in Tor consensuses for September 2014, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035207.html\">found</a> that “on average, 0.003% of nodes switch from being relay nodes to exit nodes in any given 1-hour period, and 0.002% switch from being exit nodes to relay nodes”.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000674.html\">Noel Torres</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000676.html\">Andrew Lewman</a> sent their status reports for September. Roger Dingledine also sent out the report for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000675.html\">SponsorF</a>.</p>\n<p>Greg Norcie <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035212.html\">wondered</a> why the interval at which Tor switches to using a new circuit was set at ten minutes, and Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035213.html\">responded</a> that after the original period of thirty seconds was found to be unworkable, the new number was selected in 2005 “more or less intuitively”. Paul Syverson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035217.html\">added</a> that the choice was “an informed one”, taken after “a bunch of discussions concerning the trade-offs between the overhead of the public-key operations of circuit building and the pseudonymous profiling occurring at an exit”.</p>\n<p>Both Tor and Tails received their first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/postessive/status/520956478287777792\">cinematic credits</a> with the première of “<a href=\"https://citizenfourfilm.com/\">CITIZENFOUR</a>”, a documentary film concerning the recent disclosure of intelligence documents by Edward Snowden. Eagle-eyed viewers might spot a well-known hostname in the film’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiGwAvd5mvM\">trailer</a>…</p>\n<p>WhonixQubes <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035211.html\">reported</a> on progress in many areas of the Whonix+Qubes project, which as the name implies is a combination of the <a href=\"https://www.whonix.org/\">Whonix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.qubes-os.org/\">Qubes</a> operating systems. Among other things, the system now supports Whonix 9, a community forum has been set up, and greater upstream integration is being discussed.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>\"What happens when Tor always chooses the same path?\" <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3689/88\">asks Mark</a> and wants to know which weaknesses this exposes. User194 believes that this would prevent a “predecessor attack” and make the system stronger, while Lisbeth writes: “This makes your entire traffic highly fingerprintable as compared to a standard random path. If your connections always used A, B, and C nodes, it is statistically unlikely that many other people are consistently using that same path, therefore it’s very easy to correlate your traffic to your originating IP.”</p>\n<p>Muncher visited a <a href=\"https://secure.sw.gs:419/aaw/publist/adblock.html\">website</a> which asked to add HidServAuth into the torrc and wants to know <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/3226/88\">if it is safe to do so</a>. Jeff recommended that this is safe because it doesn’t divulge anything about the identity of a user. Mirimir furthermore referred to a question where adrelanos <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/219/88\">looks for documentation</a>.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, qbi, and Harmony.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

This is a workaround reported to help while the investigation is still on-going.</p>\n<p><b>Update (Oct 25 02:32 UTC):</b> If you are unhappy with the new Firefox 31 UI, please check out <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classicthemerestorer/\">Classic Theme Restorer</a>. </p>\n<p><b>Update (Oct 16 20:35 UTC):</b> The meek transport still needs performance tuning before it matches other more conventional transports. Ticket numbers are now listed in the post.</p>\n<p>The first release of the 4.0 series is available from the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html\">Tor Browser Project page</a> and also from our <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/4.0/\">distribution directory</a>.</p>\n<p>This release features <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefox31.2.0\">important security updates</a> to Firefox. Additionally, due to the <a href=\"https://poodle.io/\">POODLE attack</a>, we have also disabled SSLv3 in this release.</p>\n<p>The primary user-facing change since the 3.6 series is the transition to Firefox 31-ESR. </p>\n<p>More importantly for censored users who were using 3.6, the 4.0 series also features the addition of three versions of the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a> pluggable transport. <b>In fact, we believe that both meek-amazon and meek-azure will work in China today, without the need to obtain bridge addresses.</b> Note though that we still need to improve meek's performance to match other transports, though. so adjust your expectations accordingly. See tickets <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12428\">#12428</a>, <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12778\">#12778</a>, and <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12857\">#12857</a> for details.</p>\n<p>This release also features an in-browser updater, and a completely reorganized bundle directory structure to make this updater possible. This means that simply extracting a 4.0 Tor Browser over a 3.6.6 Tor Browser will not work. Please also be aware that the security of the updater depends on the specific CA that issued the <a href=\"http://www.torproject.org\" title=\"www.torproject.org\">www.torproject.org</a> HTTPS certificate (Digicert), and so it still must be activated manually through the Help (\"?\") \"<i>about browser</i>\" menu option. Very soon, we will support both strong HTTPS site-specific certificate pinning (ticket <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/11955\">#11955</a>) and update package signatures (ticket <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/13379\">#13379</a>). Until then, we do not recommend using this updater if you need stronger security and normally verify GPG signatures.</p>\n<p>There are also a couple behavioral changes relating to NoScript since 3.6. In particular, by default it now enforces script enable/disable for all sub-elements of a page, so you only need to enable scripts once for a page to work, rather than enabling many sub-scripts.

If you have a version of OpenSSL that came out last week (like 1.0.1j, 1.0.0, ) and if your version of OpenSSL is built with the \"no-ssl3\" flag, then it's possible to crash your Tor relay remotely if you don't upgrade to 0.2.5.9-rc or to 0.2.4.25 (when that's out).</p>\n<p>This appears to be an OpenSSL bug.  The Tor releases in question contain a workaround for it.</p>\n<p>To tell if your version of OpenSSL was built with 'no-ssl3': run:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n<code>openssl s_client -ssl3 -connect www.torproject.org:443</code>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>If it gives you output beginning with something like:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n<code>CONNECTED(00000003)<br />\n140632971298688:error:14094410:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:sslv3<br />\nalert handshake failure:s3_pkt.c:1257:SSL alert number 40<br />\n140632971298688:error:1409E0E5:SSL routines:SSL3_WRITE_BYTES:ssl<br />\nhandshake failure:s3_pkt.c:596:<br />\n</code>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>then you're fine and you don't need to upgrade Tor on your relay.  But if it says something that starts with:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n<code>unknown option -ssl3<br />\nusage: s_client args<br />\n</code>\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>then you need to upgrade Tor.</p>\n<p><strong>Some questions and answers:</strong></p>\n<p>Q: Does this affect clients?<br />\nA: No.  Only relays.</p>\n<p>Q: Does this affect me if I'm running a version of OpenSSL other than 1.0.1j, 1.0.0o, or 0.9.8zc?<br />\nA: No. Only those versions.</p>\n<p>Q: Does this affect me if I'm running a version of OpenSSL configured without the \"no-ssl3\" option?<br />\nA: No. Only versions that were built with the \"no-ssl3\" option are affected.</p>\n<p>Q: Does the OpenSSL team know?<br />\nA: Yes. Have a look at this <a href=\"http://marc.info/?l=openssl-dev&amp;m=141357408522028&amp;w=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">thread</a>. Also, before I saw that thread, I informed them the other day.</p>\n<p>Q: Does this affect Tor packages?<br />\nA: I don't think that we shipped any packages where we used the \"no-ssl3\" flag to diable ssl3.  So only if you're using OpenSSL from another source (say, your operating system) will you be affected.</p>\n<p>Q: What can I do to remediate this problem?<br />\nA: You can upgrade to the most recent Tor, or you can use a version of OpenSSL built without the \"no-ssl3\" flag.  Downgrading your OpenSSL is not recommended.</p>\n<p>Q: What is the potential impact of this bug?<br />\nA: If a relay is affected by this bug, anybody can make the relay crash remotely. It does not enable any data leaks or remote code execution. Still, the ability to selectively disable relays might enable a sophisticated attacker to do some kinds of traffic analysis more efficiently.  So, fix your relay if it's affected.</p>\n<p>Q: Should we run in circles and freak out?<br />\nA: Not this time. We should just make sure we fix affected relays.</p>\n<p>Q: Hey, Nick, you didn't explain this properly!<br />\nA: Please send a follow-up message that explains it better. :)</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the forty-second issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor 0.2.5.9-rc is out</h1>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035302.html\">announced</a> what is hopefully the final release candidate in the Tor 0.2.5 series. It contains two enhancements in response to the recent <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-sslv3-attack-found-disable-sslv3-torbrowser\">POODLE attack on OpenSSL</a>, “even though POODLE does not affect Tor”, as well as a number of other miscellaneous improvements.</p>\n<p>Upgrading is especially important for relay operators, as a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/advisory-remote-dos-when-using-tor-recent-openssl-versions-built-no-ssl3-option\">remote crash is possible</a> when older Tor versions are used with a version of OpenSSL released last week that was built with the “no-ssl3” flag.</p>\n<p>As ever, you can download the source code from the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/\">distribution directory</a> and packages should follow shortly.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser 4.0 is out</h1>\n<p>Mike Perry <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-40-released\">announced</a> a major release by the Tor Browser team. Version 4.0 of the secure and anonymous web browser brings several exciting new features to the stable series, including the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a> censorship-circumvention tool, the secure updater, and a simplified Javascript enabling/disabling process in NoScript, all based on a customized Firefox ESR31. SSLv3 is also disabled, in response to the recent POODLE attack.</p>\n<p>This release contains important security fixes, and all users should upgrade as soon as possible. Please note that the new directory structure means users cannot simply extract the new Tor Browser over their existing 3.6.6 directory, and must instead delete the old version entirely. The secure updater still requires manual activation in the “About Tor Browser” menu option, as its security will depend “on the specific CA that issued the <a href=\"http://www.torproject.org\" title=\"www.torproject.org\">www.torproject.org</a> HTTPS certificate (Digicert)” until <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/11955\">site-specific certificate pinning</a> and <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13379\">signed update files</a> are implemented. Furthermore, “we still need to improve meek’s performance to match other transports”, wrote Mike, “so adjust your expectations accordingly”.</p>\n<p>See Mike’s post for further details and a full changelog, and get your copy of Tor Browser 4.0 from the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/4.0/\">distribution directory</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy\">download page</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tails 1.2 is out</h1>\n<p>The Tails team put out <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.2/\">version 1.2</a> of the anonymizing live operating system. This release replaces the Iceweasel browser with “most of” the regular Tor Browser, and confines several important applications with AppArmor.</p>\n<p>I2P will now, like Tor, be started upon network connection if activated with the “i2p” boot parameter, and must be used with the new dedicated I2P Browser. This is also the last Tails release to ship with the now-unmaintained TrueCrypt tool, but the Tails team has already documented the method for <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/truecrypt/index#cryptsetup\">opening TrueCrypt volumes with cryptsetup</a>. See the team’s announcement for a full list of changes in the new version.</p>\n<p>This is an important security release and all users should upgrade as soon as possible. If you have a running Tails, you should be able to use the incremental updater; if your Tails drive was manually created, or you are a new user, head to the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/download/\">download page</a> for more information.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>tagnaq <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035285.html\">warned</a> users of <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/torbirdy\">TorBirdy</a>, the torifying extension for the Thunderbird mail client, that a change in Thunderbird 31’s handling of the “reply_header_authorwrote” header means that the word “wrote”, translated into the user’s system language, may be inserted before quoted text when replying to emails, leaking the system language to recipients of replies if not removed. Jacob Appelbaum <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035305.html\">responded</a> that a new release of TorBirdy addressing this and other issues was imminent.</p>\n<p>Arturo Filastò <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/ooni-dev/2014-October/000177.html\">announced</a> the release of ooniprobe 1.1.2, containing “two new report entry keys, test_start_time and test_runtime”, and a fix for a bug that “led to ooniresources not working properly”.</p>\n<p>evilaliv3 <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007641.html\">announced</a> version 3.1.20 of tor2web, an HTTP proxy that enables access to hidden services without a Tor client, for users who do not require strong anonymity. As well as “some networking bugfixing and optimizations”, this release adds a “replace” mode for remotely-fetched blocklists in addition to “merge”, and a feature that allows different hostnames to be mapped to specific hidden services.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing gave users of Onionoo a “<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/onionoo-announce/2014/000001.html\">one-month heads-up</a>” that on or after November 15th, a change to the protocol will let the search parameter “accept base64-encoded fingerprints in addition to hex-encoded fingerprints, nicknames, and IP addresses.” These searches will also return relays whose base64-encoded fingerprints are a partial match for the search string. “If you’re fine with that, feel free to ignore this message and do nothing”, but if not, “you’ll have to filter out those relays locally”.</p>\n<p>Following updates to the Tor Project’s website, Sebastian Hahn <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-October/000727.html\">drew attention</a> to a change in the steps necessary to <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/running-a-mirror\">run a website mirror</a>. “Please ask if you run into any trouble, and thanks for providing a mirror!”</p>\n<p>Inspired by “the Directory Authorities, the crappy experiment leading up to Black Hat, and the promise that one can recreate the Tor network in the event of some catastrophe”, Tom Ritter sent out a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007613.html\">detailed report</a> of issues he encountered while setting up his own Tor network using “full-featured independent tor daemons”, rather than a <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#PrivateTorNetwork\">network simulator</a> like Shadow or Chutney.</p>\n<p>Cthulhu asked for assistance in overhauling the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13421\">GoodBadISP page</a>, which is the starting point for many relay operators around the world. If you have some time to spare, or know some ISPs not yet on the list, it would be greatly appreciated if they could be added to the page. This new effort to reach out to hosting providers could be of great value after years of what Roger Dingledine has <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-October/005495.html\">described</a> as a “slash and burn” agriculture model of operating Tor nodes.</p>\n<p>Vladimir Martyanov started a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007619.html\">discussion</a> on the question of whether Tor developers should ensure that tor can still be built using compilers that do not support the C99 programming language standard, such as older versions of Microsoft Visual Studio.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Lunar, Cthulhu, Roger Dingledine, Karsten Loesing, and Harmony.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

As Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2014-October/000096.html\">explained</a>, there have been no changes since last week’s 0.2.5.9-rc release, and the new features will be familiar to readers of Tor Weekly News over the past year of development, but highlights include “improved denial-of-service resistance for relays, new compiler hardening options, and a system-call sandbox for hardened installations on Linux”, as well as improvements to transparent proxying, building and testing, pluggable transport usability, and much more.</p>\n<p>This release means that Tor versions in the 0.2.3.x series, which has “received no patches or attention for some while” and “accumulated many known flaws”, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-October/005590.html\">are now deprecated</a>. Relay operators running these versions must upgrade as soon as possible, or risk having their relays rejected from the network in the near future.</p>\n<p>Please see Nick’s release announcement for the full changelog, and download your copy of the 0.2.5.10 source code from the <a href=\"https://dist.torproject.org/\">distribution directory</a> or a prebuilt package from your usual repositories.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Jacob Appelbaum <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035326.html\">announced</a> version 0.1.3 of TorBirdy, a torifying extension for the Thunderbird email client. Among other things, this release fixes the recently-reported <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13480\">“wrote:” bug</a>, disables the automatic downloading of messages from POP3 accounts, and ensures that draft messages for IMAP accounts are stored on the local system rather than sent over the network. However, as Jacob wrote, “it’s still experimental”, so “use at your own risk”. See the release announcement for a full changelog.</p>\n<p>Anthony G. Basile <a href=\"http://opensource.dyc.edu/pipermail/tor-ramdisk/2014-October/000134.html\">announced</a> version 20141022 of tor-ramdisk, the micro Linux distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that maximizes security and privacy. This release addresses the recent <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/new-sslv3-attack-found-disable-sslv3-torbrowser\">POODLE attack</a> with updates to Tor and OpenSSL, and also upgrades the Linux kernel.</p>\n<p>Yawning Angel <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007670.html\">called for testing</a> of the revamped tor-fw-helper, a tool that automates the port forwarding required (for example) by the <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/flashproxy/\">flash proxy</a> pluggable transport. Please see Yawning’s message for full testing instructions and other important information: “Questions, Comments, Feedback appreciated”.</p>\n<p>On the Tor blog, Andrew Lewman <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-misused-criminals\">responded</a> to the abuse of Tor by creators of so-called “ransomware”, or malware that tries to restrict access to users’ files unless a ransom is paid; these extortionists sometimes ask their victims to install Tor software in order to communicate with them over a hidden service, leading users to the mistaken belief that The Tor Project is somehow involved. As Andrew wrote, this software “is unrelated to The Tor Project. We didn’t produce it, and we didn’t ask to be included in the criminal infection of any computer.” Users may find the information provided by the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28661463\">BBC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/cryptolocker-ransomware-information\">Bleeping Computer</a> to be helpful in resolving the problem.</p>\n<p>Josh Pitts posted an <a href=\"http://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/the-case-of-the-modified-binaries/\">analysis</a> of apparently malicious behavior by a Tor relay that was modifying binary files downloaded over Tor circuits in which it was the exit node. As Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035340.html\">responded</a>, “we’ve now set the BadExit flag on this relay, so others won’t accidentally run across it”.</p>\n<p>David Fifield <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-October/007659.html\">pointed out</a> “an apparent negative correlation between obfs3 users and vanilla users” in the Tor Metrics portal’s <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/users.html?graph=userstats-bridge-transport&amp;transport=%3COR%3E&amp;transport=obfs3#userstats-bridge-transport\">bridge user graphs</a> and wondered what might be causing it.</p>\n<h1>News from Tor StackExchange</h1>\n<p>Dodo wants to run several hidden services (HTTP, XMPP, SSH etc.), but use <a href=\"https://tor.stackexchange.com/q/4437/88\">just one onion address</a>.

Out-of-memory conditions are handled better than in 0.2.5, pluggable transports have improved proxy support, and clients now use optimistic data for contacting hidden services. Also, we are now more robust to changes in what we consider a parseable directory object, so that tightening restrictions does not have a risk of introducing infinite download loops. </p>\n<p>This is the first alpha release in a new series, so expect there to be bugs. Users who would rather test out a more stable branch should stay with 0.2.5.x for now. </p>\n<p>This announcement is for the source release only; I'd expect that compiled packages for several platforms should be available over the next several days.</p>\nChanges in version 0.2.6.1-alpha - 2014-10-30\n<ul>\n<li>New compiler and system requirements:\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tor 0.2.6.x requires that your compiler support more of the C99 language standard than before. The 'configure' script now detects whether your compiler supports C99 mid-block declarations and designated initializers. If it does not, Tor will not compile. </p>\n<p>We may revisit this requirement if it turns out that a significant number of people need to build Tor with compilers that don't bother implementing a 15-year-old standard. Closes ticket 13233. </p>\n<li>Tor no longer supports systems without threading support. When we began working on Tor, there were several systems that didn't have threads, or where the thread support wasn't able to run the threads of a single process on multiple CPUs. That no longer holds: every system where Tor needs to run well now has threading support.

    "content": "<p>Today Facebook unveiled its <a href=\"https://facebookcorewwwi.onion/\">hidden service</a> that lets users access their website more safely. Users and journalists have been asking for our response; here are some points to help you understand our thinking.</p>\n<h2>Part one: yes, visiting Facebook over Tor is not a contradiction</h2>\n<p>I didn't even realize I should include this section, until I heard from a journalist today who hoped to get a quote from me about why Tor users wouldn't ever use Facebook. Putting aside the (still very important) questions of Facebook's privacy habits, their harmful real-name policies, and whether you should or shouldn't tell them anything about you, the key point here is that <b>anonymity isn't just about hiding from your destination</b>.</p>\n<p>There's no reason to let your ISP know when or whether you're visiting Facebook. There's no reason for Facebook's upstream ISP, or some agency that surveils the Internet, to learn when and whether you use Facebook. And if you do choose to tell Facebook something about you, there's still no reason to let them automatically discover what city you're in today while you do it.</p>\n<p>Also, we should remember that there are some places in the world that can't reach Facebook. Long ago I talked to a Facebook security person who told me a fun story. When he first learned about Tor, he hated and feared it because it \"clearly\" intended to undermine their business model of learning everything about all their users. Then suddenly Iran blocked Facebook, a good chunk of the Persian Facebook population switched over to reaching Facebook via Tor, and he became a huge Tor fan because otherwise those users would have been cut off. Other countries like China followed a similar pattern after that. This switch in his mind between \"Tor as a privacy tool to let users control their own data\" to \"Tor as a communications tool to give users freedom to choose what sites they visit\" is a great example of the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers\">diversity of uses for Tor</a>: whatever it is you think Tor is for, I guarantee there's a person out there who uses it for something you haven't considered.</p>\n<h2>Part two: we're happy to see broader adoption of hidden services</h2>\n<p>I think it is great for Tor that Facebook has added a .onion address. There are some compelling use cases for hidden services: see for example the ones described at <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/using-tor-good\">using Tor hidden services for good</a>, as well as upcoming decentralized chat tools like Ricochet where every user is a hidden service, so there's no central point to tap or lean on to retain data. But we haven't really publicized these examples much, especially compared to the publicity that the \"I have a website that the man wants to shut down\" examples have gotten in recent years.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services\">Hidden services</a> provide a variety of useful security properties. First &mdash; and the one that most people think of &mdash; because the design uses <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/overview#thesolution\">Tor circuits</a>, it's hard to discover where the service is located in the world. But second, because the address of the service is <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/rend-spec.txt#l527\">the hash of its key</a>, they are self-authenticating: if you type in a given .onion address, your Tor client guarantees that it really is talking to the service that knows the private key that corresponds to the address. A third nice feature is that the rendezvous process provides end-to-end encryption, even when the application-level traffic is unencrypted. </p>\n<p>So I am excited that this move by Facebook will help to continue opening people's minds about why they might want to offer a hidden service, and help other people think of further novel uses for hidden services.</p>\n<p>Another really nice implication here is that Facebook is committing to taking its Tor users seriously. Hundreds of thousands of people have been successfully using Facebook over Tor for years, but in today's era of services like Wikipedia <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/call-arms-helping-internet-services-accept-anonymous-users\">choosing not to accept contributions from users who care about privacy</a>, it is refreshing and heartening to see a large website decide that it's ok for their users to want more safety.</p>\n<p>As an addendum to that optimism, I would be really sad if Facebook added a hidden service, had a few problems with trolls, and decided that they should prevent Tor users from using their old <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/\" title=\"https://www.facebook.com/\">https://www.facebook.com/</a> address. So we should be vigilant in helping Facebook continue to allow Tor users to reach them through either address.</p>\n<h2>Part three: their vanity address doesn't mean the world has ended</h2>\n<p>Their hidden service name is \"facebookcorewwwi.onion\". For a hash of a public key, that sure doesn't look random. Many people have been wondering how they <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack\">brute forced</a> the entire name.</p>\n<p>The short answer is that for the first half of it (\"facebook\"), which is only 40 bits, they generated keys over and over until they got some keys whose first 40 bits of the hash matched the string they wanted.</p>\n<p>Then they had some keys whose name started with \"facebook\", and they looked at the second half of each of them to pick out the ones with pronouncable and thus memorable syllables. The \"corewwwi\" one looked best to them &mdash; meaning they could come up with a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym\">story</a> about why that's a reasonable name for Facebook to use &mdash; <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035413.html\">so they went with it</a>.</p>\n<p>So to be clear, they would not be able to produce exactly this name again if they wanted to. They could produce other hashes that start with \"facebook\" and end with pronouncable syllables, but that's not brute forcing all of the hidden service name (all 80 bits).</p>\n<p>For those who want to explore the math more, read about the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack\">\"birthday attack\"</a>. And for those who want to learn more (please help!) about the improvements we'd like to make for hidden services, including stronger keys and stronger names, see <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love\">hidden services need some love</a> and <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt\">Tor proposal 224</a>.</p>\n<h2>Part four: what do we think about an https cert for a .onion address?</h2>\n<p>Facebook didn't just set up a hidden service. They also got an https certificate for their hidden service, and it's signed by Digicert so your browser will accept it. This choice has produced some <a href=\"https://cabforum.org/pipermail/public/2014-October/thread.html#4210\">feisty discussions</a> in the CA/Browser community, which decides what kinds of names can get official certificates. That discussion is still ongoing, but here are my early thoughts on it.</p>\n<p>In favor: we, the Internet security community, have taught people that https is necessary and http is scary. So it makes sense that users want to see the string \"https\" in front of them.</p>\n<p>Against: Tor's .onion handshake basically gives you all of that for free, so by encouraging people to pay Digicert we're reinforcing the CA business model when maybe we should be continuing to demonstrate an alternative.</p>\n<p>In favor: Actually https does give you a little bit more, in the case where the service (Facebook's webserver farm) isn't in the same location as the Tor program. Remember that there's no requirement for the webserver and the Tor process to be on the same machine, and in a complicated set-up like Facebook's they probably shouldn't be. One could argue that this last mile is inside their corporate network, so who cares if it's unencrypted, but I think the simple phrase \"ssl added and removed here\" will kill that argument.</p>\n<p>Against: if one site gets a cert, it will further reinforce to users that it's \"needed\", and then the users will start asking other sites why they don't have one. I worry about starting a trend where you need to pay Digicert money to have a hidden service or your users think it's sketchy &mdash; especially since hidden services that value their anonymity could have a hard time getting a certificate.</p>\n<p>One alternative would be to teach Tor Browser that https .onion addresses don't deserve a scary pop-up warning. A more thorough approach in that direction is to have a way for a hidden service to generate its own signed https cert using its onion private key, and teach Tor Browser how to verify them &mdash; basically a decentralized CA for .onion addresses, since they are self-authenticating anyway. Then you don't have to go through the nonsense of pretending to see if they could read email at the domain, and generally furthering the current CA model.</p>\n<p>We could also imagine a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petname\">pet name</a> model where the user can tell her Tor Browser that this .onion address \"is\" Facebook. Or the more direct approach would be to ship a bookmark list of \"known\" hidden services in Tor Browser &mdash; like being our own CA, using the old-fashioned /etc/hosts model. That approach would raise the political question though of which sites we should endorse in this way.</p>\n<p>So I haven't made up my mind yet about which direction I think this discussion should go. I'm sympathetic to \"we've taught the users to check for https, so let's not confuse them\", but I also worry about the slippery slope where getting a cert becomes a required step to having a reputable service. Let us know if you have other compelling arguments for or against.</p>\n<h2>Part five: what remains to be done?</h2>\n<p>In terms of both design and security, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love\">hidden services still need some love</a>. We have plans for improved designs (see <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt\">Tor proposal 224</a>) but we don't have enough funding and developers to make it happen. We've been talking to some Facebook engineers this week about hidden service reliability and scalability, and we're excited that Facebook is thinking of putting development effort into helping improve hidden services.</p>\n<p>And finally, speaking of teaching people about the security features of .onion sites, I wonder if \"hidden services\" is no longer the best phrase here. Originally we called them \"location-hidden services\", which was quickly shortened in practice to just \"hidden services\". But protecting the location of the service is just one of the security features you get. Maybe we should hold a contest to come up with a new name for these protected services? Even something like \"onion services\" might be better if it forces people to learn what it is.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the forty-fourth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor 0.2.6.1-alpha is out</h1>\n<p>Following last week’s stabilization of Tor 0.2.5.x, Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035390.html\">announced</a> the first alpha release in the Tor 0.2.6.x series. Quoting the changelog, this version “includes numerous code cleanups and new tests, and fixes a large number of annoying bugs. Out-of-memory conditions are handled better than in 0.2.5, pluggable transports have improved proxy support, and clients now use optimistic data for contacting hidden services.” Support for some very old compilers that do not understand the C99 programming standard, systems without threading support, and the Windows CE operating system has also been dropped.</p>\n<p>“This is the first alpha release in a new series, so expect there to be bugs.” If you want to test it out, you can find the source code in the <a href=\"https://dist.torproject.org/\">distribution directory</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser 4.0.1 is out</h1>\n<p>Mike Perry <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-401-released\">announced</a> a bugfix release by the Tor Browser team.  This version disables <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectShow\">DirectShow</a>, which was causing the Windows build of Tor Browser to <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13443\">crash</a> when visiting many websites. This is not a security release, but Windows users who have experienced this issue should upgrade.</p>\n<p>Please see Mike’s post for the changelog, and download your copy from the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html\">project page</a>.</p>\n<h1>Facebook, hidden services, and HTTPS certificates</h1>\n<p>Facebook, one of the world’s most popular websites, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/protect-the-graph/making-connections-to-facebook-more-secure/1526085754298237\">surprised the Internet</a> by becoming the most prominent group so far to set up a Tor hidden service. Rather than connecting through an exit relay, Facebook users can now interact with the social network without their traffic leaving the Tor network at all until it reaches its destination.</p>\n<p>Soon after the service was announced, some in the Tor community expressed concern over the implications of its <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035403.html\">unusually memorable .onion address</a>. Had Facebook somehow mustered the computing power to brute-force hidden service keys at will? Alec Muffett, one of the lead engineers behind the project, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035413.html\">clarified</a> that in fact “we just did the same thing as everyone else: generated a bunch of keys with a fixed lead prefix (‘facebook’) and then went fishing looking for good ones”, getting “tremendous lucky” in the process. Those concerned by how easy this seems, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-October/035416.html\">added</a> Nick Mathewson, “might want to jump in on reviewing and improving <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt\">proposal 224</a>, which includes a brand-new, even less usable, but far more secure, name format”.</p>\n<p>“Why would you want to use Facebook over Tor?” remains a frequently-asked (and -misunderstood) question, so Roger Dingledine took to the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/facebook-hidden-services-and-https-certs\">Tor blog</a> to address this and related issues. “The key point here is that anonymity isn’t just about hiding from your destination. There’s no reason to let your ISP know when or whether you’re visiting Facebook. There’s no reason for Facebook’s upstream ISP, or some agency that surveils the Internet, to learn when and whether you use Facebook. And if you do choose to tell Facebook something about you, there’s still no reason to let them automatically discover what city you’re in today while you do it.” Not only that, but Facebook is now taking advantage of the special security properties that hidden services provide, including strong authentication (letting users be confident that they are talking to the right server, and not to an impostor) and end-to-end encryption of their data.</p>\n<p>This last point generated some confusion, since Facebook have also acquired an HTTPS certificate for their hidden service, which might seem like an unnecessary belt-and-suspenders approach to security. This has been the subject of “feisty discussions” in the Internet security community, with many points for and against: on the one hand, users have been taught that “https is necessary and http is scary, so it makes sense that users want to see the string “https” in front of” URLs, while on the other, “by encouraging people to pay Digicert we’re reinforcing the certificate authority business model when maybe we should be continuing to demonstrate an alternative.”</p>\n<p>Please see Roger’s post for a fuller discussion of all these points and more, and feel free to contribute your own thoughts on the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk\">tor-talk mailing list</a>. If you experience problems with the service, please contact Facebook support rather than the Tor help desk; as Alec wrote in the announcement, “we expect the service to be of an evolutionary and slightly flaky nature”, as it is an “experiment” — hopefully an experiment that will, as Roger suggested, “help to continue opening people’s minds about why they might want to offer a hidden service, and help other people think of further novel uses for hidden services.”</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for October 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of October has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000677.html\">Juha Nurmi</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000678.html\">Georg Koppen</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000679.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-October/000680.html\">Pearl Crescent</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000682.html\">Lunar</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000683.html\">Harmony</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000684.html\">Sukhbir Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000685.html\">Colin C.</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000687.html\">Leiah Jansen</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000688.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000689.html\">Arlo Breault</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000690.html\">Noel Torres</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000691.html\">George Kadianakis</a>.</p>\n<p>Lunar reported on behalf of the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000681.html\">help desk</a>, Arturo Filastò for the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000686.html\">OONI team</a>, and Mike Perry for the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000692.html\">Tor Browser team</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Mike Perry <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tbb-dev/2014-October/000148.html\">updated</a> the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/\">Tor Browser design document</a> to cover Tor Browser version 4.0 — “Feedback welcome!

    "content": "<h1>What happened</h1>\n<p>Recently it was <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/global-action-against-dark-markets-tor-network\">announced</a> that a coalition of government agencies took control of many Tor hidden services. We were as surprised as most of you. Unfortunately, we have very little information about how this was accomplished, but we do have some thoughts which we want to share.</p>\n<p>Over the last few days, we received and read reports saying that several Tor relays were seized by government officials. We do not know why the systems were seized, nor do we know anything about the methods of investigation which were used. Specifically, there are <a href=\"https://blog.torservers.net/20141109/three-servers-offline-likely-seized.html\">reports that three systems of Torservers.net disappeared</a> and there is another <a href=\"https://raided4tor.wordpress.com\"/>report by an independent relay operator</a>. If anyone has more details, please get in contact with us. If your relay was seized, please also tell us its identity so that we can request that the directory authorities reject it from the network.</p>\n<p>But, more to the point, the recent publications call the targeted hidden services seizures \"Operation Onymous\" and they say it was coordinated by Europol and other government entities. Early reports say 17 people were arrested, and 400 hidden services were seized.  <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/politics/oops-we-counted-wrong-silk-road-dark-net-tor/\">Later reports</a> have clarified that it was hundreds of URLs hosted on roughly 27 web sites offering hidden services. We have not been contacted directly or indirectly by Europol nor any other agency involved.</p>\n<p>Tor is most interested in understanding how these services were located, and if this indicates a security weakness in Tor hidden services that could be exploited by criminals or secret police repressing dissents. We are also interested in learning why the authorities seized Tor relays even though their operation was targetting hidden services. Were these two events related?</p>\n<h1>How did they locate the hidden services?</h1>\n<p>So we are left asking \"How did they locate the hidden services?\". We don't know. In liberal democracies, we should expect that when the time comes to prosecute some of the seventeen people who have been arrested, the police would have to explain to the judge how the suspects came to be suspects, and that as a side benefit of the operation of justice, Tor could learn if there are security flaws in hidden services or other critical internet-facing services.  We know through recent leaks that the US DEA and others have constructed a system of organized and sanctioned perjury which they refer to as \"parallel construction.\"</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the authorities did not specify how they managed to locate the hidden services. Here are some plausible scenarios:</p>\n<h2>Operational Security</h2>\n<p>The first and most obvious explanation is that the operators of these hidden services failed to use adequate operational security. For example, there are reports of one of the websites being infiltrated by undercover agents and the <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/1354808-blake-benthall-complaint.html\">affidavit</a> states various <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B1xhq32CIAAuc8y.png\">operational security errors</a>.</p>\n<h2>SQL injections</h2>\n<p>Another explanation is exploitation of common web bugs like SQL injections or RFIs (remote file inclusions). Many of those websites were likely quickly-coded e-shops with a big attack surface. Exploitable bugs in web applications are a common problem.</p>\n<h2>Bitcoin deanonymization</h2>\n<p>Ivan Pustogarov et al. have <a href=\"https://crypto.stanford.edu/seclab/sem-14-15/pustogarov.html\">recently</a> been conducting interesting <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7418\">research on Bitcoin anonymity</a>.</p>\n<p>Apparently, there are ways to link transactions and deanonymize Bitcoin clients even if they use Tor. Maybe the seized hidden services were running Bitcoin clients themselves and were victims of similar attacks.</p>\n<h2>Attacks on the Tor network</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-November/035606.html\">number of takedowns</a> and the fact that Tor relays were seized could also mean that the Tor network was attacked to reveal the location of those hidden services. We received some <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007731.html\">interesting information</a> from an operator of a now-seized hidden service which may indicate this, as well. Over the past few years, researchers have discovered various attacks on the Tor network. We've implemented some <a href=\"http://www.nrl.navy.mil/itd/chacs/overlier-locating-hidden-servers\">defenses</a> against these attacks, but these defenses do not solve all known issues and there may even be attacks unknown to us.</p>\n<p>For example, some months ago, someone was launching <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack\">non-targetted deanonymization attacks</a> on the live Tor network. People suspect that those attacks were carried out by <a href=\"https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/felten/why-were-cert-researchers-attacking-tor/\">CERT researchers</a>. While the bug was fixed and the fix quickly deployed in the network, it's <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TOR/comments/2lip12/silk_road_as_well_as_others_were_likely/\">possible</a> that as part of their attack, they managed to deanonymize some of those hidden services.</p>\n<p>Another possible Tor attack vector could be the <em>Guard Discovery attack</em>. This attack doesn't reveal the identity of the hidden service, but allows an attacker to discover the guard node of a specific hidden service. The guard node is the only node in the whole network that knows the actual IP address of the hidden service. Hence, if the attacker then manages to compromise the guard node or somehow obtain access to it, she can launch a traffic confirmation attack to learn the identity of the hidden service. We've been<br />\n<a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-July/007122.html\">discussing</a> <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-September/007472.html\">various</a> <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007726.html\">solutions</a> to the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/9001\">guard discovery attack</a> for the past many months but it's <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007730.html\">not an easy problem to fix properly</a>. Help and feedback on the proposed designs is appreciated.</p>\n<p>*Similarly, there exists the attack where the hidden service selects the attacker's relay as its guard node. This may happen randomly or this could occur if the hidden service selects another relay as its guard and the attacker renders that node unusable, by a <a href=\"http://www.robgjansen.com/publications/sniper-ndss2014.pdf\">denial of service attack</a> or similar. The hidden service will then be forced to select a new guard. Eventually, the hidden service will select the attacker.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, denial of service attacks on relays or clients in the Tor network can often be leveraged into full de-anonymization attacks. These techniques go back many years, in research such as <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/trickle02.pdf\">\"From a Trickle to a Flood\"</a>, <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/cache/ccs07-doa.pdf\">\"Denial of Service or Denial of Security?\"</a>, <a href=\"http://www.syverson.org/entropist-final.pdf\">\"Why I'm not an Entropist\"</a>, and even the more recent Bitcoin attacks above. In the Hidden Service protocol there are more vectors for DoS attacks, such as the set of HSDirs and the Introduction Points of a Hidden Service.</p>\n<p>Finally, remote code execution exploits against Tor software are also always a possibility, but we have zero evidence that such exploits exist. Although the Tor source code gets continuously reviewed by our security-minded developers and community members, we would like more focused auditing by experienced bug hunters. Public-interest initiatives like Project Zero could help out a lot here. Funding to launch a bug bounty program of our own could also bring real benefit to our codebase. If you can help, please get in touch.</p>\n<h1>Advice to concerned hidden service operators</h1>\n<p>As you can see, we still don't know what happened, and it's hard to give concrete suggestions blindly.</p>\n<p>If you are a concerned hidden service operator, we suggest you read the cited resources to get a better understanding of the security that hidden services can offer and of the limitations of the current system. When it comes to anonymity, it's clear that the tighter your threat model is, the more informed you need to be about the technologies you use.</p>\n<p>If your hidden service lacks sufficient processor, memory, or network resources the DoS based de-anonymization attacks may be easy to leverage against your service. Be sure to review the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/blob/HEAD:/doc/TUNING\">Tor performance tuning guide</a> to optimize your relay or client.</p>\n<p>*Another possible suggestion we can provide is manually selecting the guard node of a hidden service. By configuring the EntryNodes option in Tor's <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-manual.html.en#EntryNodes\">configuration file</a> you can select a relay in the Tor network you trust. Keep in mind, however, that a determined attacker will still be able to determine this relay is your guard and all other attacks still apply.</p>\n<h1>Final words</h1>\n<p>The  task of hiding the location of <b>low-latency</b> web  services is a very hard problem and we still don't know how to do it correctly. It seems that there are various issues that none of the current anonymous publishing designs have really solved.</p>\n<p>In a way, it's even surprising that hidden services have survived so far. <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love\">The attention they have received is minimal</a> compared to their social value and compared to the size and determination of their adversaries.</p>\n<p>It would be great if there were more people reviewing our designs and code. For example, we would really appreciate feedback on the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/blob/HEAD:/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt\">upcoming hidden service revamp</a> or help with the research on guard discovery attacks (see links above).</p>\n<p>Also, it's important to note that Tor currently doesn't have funding for improving the security of hidden services. If you are interested in funding hidden services research and development, please get in touch with us. We hope to find time to organize a crowdfunding campaign to acquire independent and focused hidden service funding.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you are a relay operator and your server was recently compromised or you lost control of it, <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/how-report-bad-relays\">please let us know</a> by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:bad-relays@lists.torproject.org\">bad-relays@lists.torproject.org</a>. </p>\n<p>Thanks to Griffin, Matt, Adam, Roger, David, George, Karen, and Jake for contributions to this post.</p>\n<p>Updates:<br />\n* Added information about guard node DoS and EntryNodes option - 2014/11/09 18:16 UTC</p>"

We are honored to be working alongside Mozilla as well as the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology to give Firefox users more options to protect their privacy. </p>\n<h1>Why Mozilla?</h1>\n<p>Mozilla is an industry leader in developing features to support the user’s desire for increased privacy online and shares the Tor Project's mission of helping people protect their security online. At the core of Mozilla's values is the belief that individuals’ privacy cannot be treated as optional. We share this belief. Millions of people around the world rely on the protection of the Tor software and network to safeguard their anonymity. We appreciate companies like Mozilla that see the importance of safeguarding privacy. The Tor volunteer network has grown to the point that large companies can usefully contribute without hurting network diversity. The Tor network will get even better with Mozilla's help, and we hope that their participation will encourage even more organizations to join us.</p>\n<p>The initial projects with Mozilla will focus on two areas:</p>\n<h2>Engineering support:&nbsp;</h2>\n<p> The Tor Browser is built on the Firefox platform and we are excited to have the resources of Mozilla’s engineers to help us merge the many Firefox privacy fixes into the Mozilla codebase. The increased attention from Mozilla will give us time to focus on finding and fixing new issues rather than maintaining our fork.</p>\n<h2>Network Support:</h2>\n<p> Tor's network size constrains the number of users that can use Tor concurrently. In the short term, Mozilla will help address this by hosting high-capacity Tor middle relays to make Tor’s network more responsive and allow Tor to serve more users.</p>\n<p>We believe that the Tor Browser is one of the best ways to protect privacy on the web and this partnership is a huge step in advancing people’s right to freedom of expression online.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the forty-fifth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Mozilla announces Polaris Privacy Initiative</h1>\n<p>Mozilla, makers of the Firefox browser upon which Tor Browser is based, <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/privacy/2014/11/10/introducing-polaris-privacy-initiative-to-accelerate-user-focused-privacy-online\">announced</a> a series of projects to “accelerate pragmatic and user-focused advances in privacy technology for the Web, giving users more control, awareness and protection in their Web experiences”. The Tor Project is one of Mozilla’s two partners in this Polaris Privacy Initiative, and the collaboration will involve looking at the Firefox codebase to see if its relationship to Tor Browser and the Tor development process can be made more efficient, giving Tor engineers more time to focus on other important issues. Mozilla also stated their intention to run several high-capacity Tor middle relays, contributing to a faster and more stable Tor network.</p>\n<p>As Andrew Lewman <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/partnering-mozilla\">wrote</a> on the Tor blog, “the Tor Browser is one of the best ways to protect privacy on the web and this partnership is a huge step in advancing people’s right to freedom of expression online”. Watch for more announcements as work on these two fronts continues.</p>\n<h1>Tor and Operation Onymous</h1>\n<p>An international coalition of law enforcement authorities <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/global-action-against-dark-markets-tor-network\">announced</a> the seizure of over 400 Tor hidden services allegedly engaging in illegal activity. Once the desired headlines had been written, something approaching the facts began to emerge, with the claimed number of seized services <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/politics/oops-we-counted-wrong-silk-road-dark-net-tor/\">dropping sharply to 27</a>; more troublingly, several high-capacity Tor relays with no apparent connection to the hidden services were <a href=\"https://blog.torservers.net/20141109/three-servers-offline-likely-seized.html\">also</a> <a href=\"https://raided4tor.wordpress.com/\">seized</a>.  However, in contrast to the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack\">last major takedown of hidden services</a>, which involved one shared hidden service hosting platform, there was no obvious single feature linking all of the seized sites, leading to concern in the Tor community that an exploit against the Tor network may have been responsible for their discovery.</p>\n<p>It could be that these services were deanonymized individually over a period of months using a variety of means, then all seized at once for maximum effect: as Andrew Lewman and others wrote in a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/thoughts-and-concerns-about-operation-onymous\">response</a> posted to the Tor blog, these methods could include operational security mistakes by service operators, exploitation of flaws in poorly-written website code, or attacks on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency that is widely used on hidden service marketplaces. On the other hand, if an attack on the Tor network itself is at play, it may be a variant of the class of attack known as “traffic confirmation”, like the one <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-news/2014-August/000057.html\">observed earlier this year</a>. “Unfortunately,” as the blog post notes, ”the authorities did not specify how they managed to locate the hidden services”; even if they had, recent disclosures concerning <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_construction\">“parallel construction” in law enforcement</a> mean that the public would not necessarily be able to trust their explanation.</p>\n<p>“Hidden services need some love” has become a familiar refrain in recent months, and even though the story behind these seizures may remain unknown, they have reinvigorated some long-running threads on improvements to the security of this important technology. George Kadianakis <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007730.html\">coded</a> a patch that allows hidden service operators to “specify a set of nodes that will be pinned as middle nodes in hidden service rendezvous circuits”, while the theory behind this <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007726.html\">continues to be discussed</a>, as does the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007735.html\">hidden service authorization feature</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007744.html\">how widely it is used in practice</a>.</p>\n<p>“The attention hidden services have received is minimal compared to their social value and compared to the size and determination of their adversaries.” If you are a hidden service operator concerned by these seizures, or you want to help ensure the possibility of free and uncensorable publishing online, see the group blog post for more details, and feel free to join in with the discussions on the tor-dev mailing list.</p>\n<h1>More monthly status reports for October 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the  month of October continued, with reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000693.html\">Isis Lovecruft</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000694.html\">Nicolas Vigier</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000695.html\">Damian Johnson</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000696.html\">Karsten Loesing</a>.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine sent out the report for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-November/000697.html\">SponsorF</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Arturo Filastò <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ooni-bridge-reachability-study-and-hackfest\">reported</a> on OONI’s ongoing study of Tor bridge reachability in different countries, and the recent hackfest on the same topic.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing offered an <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/onionoo-announce/2014/000002.html\">update</a> on developments in the world of Onionoo, including new mirrors and search improvements.</p>\n<h1>Help desk round up</h1>\n<p>The help desk has been asked how to run Tor Browser on a Chromebook. ChromeOS does not allow any programs to be executed except Google Chrome, including other browsers like Tor Browser. The workaround for this is to install a Debian or Ubuntu environment within ChromeOS using <a href=\"https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton\">crouton</a>. Once crouton is ready, Tor Browser for Linux can be downloaded and installed in the Debian or Ubuntu environment. Crouton users should seek support from the crouton team and not from the Tor help desk.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Harmony, Matt Pagan, Karsten Loesing, and Lunar.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>People are starting to ask us about a recent <a href=\"https://mice.cs.columbia.edu/getTechreport.php?techreportID=1545&amp;format=pdf\">tech report</a> from Sambuddho's group about how an attacker with access to many routers around the Internet could gather the netflow logs from these routers and match up Tor flows. It's great to see more research on traffic correlation attacks, especially on attacks that don't need to see the whole flow on each side. But it's also important to realize that traffic correlation attacks are not a new area.</p>\n<p>This blog post aims to give you some background to get you up to speed on the topic.</p>\n<p>First, you should read the first few paragraphs of the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/one-cell-enough\">One cell is enough to break Tor's anonymity</a> analysis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nFirst, remember the basics of how Tor provides anonymity. Tor clients <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/images/htw2.png\">route their traffic</a> over several (<a href=\"https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#VariablePathLength\">usually three</a>) relays, with the goal that no single relay gets to learn both where the user is (call her Alice) and what site she's reaching (call it Bob).</p>\n<p>The Tor design <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/svn/trunk/doc/design-paper/tor-design.html#subsec:threat-model\">doesn't try to protect</a> against an attacker who can see or measure both traffic going into the Tor network and also traffic coming out of the Tor network. That's because if you can see both flows, some <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#danezis:pet2004\">simple statistics</a> let you decide whether they match up.</p>\n<p>Because we aim to let people browse the web, we can't afford the extra overhead and hours of additional delay that are used in high-latency mix networks like <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#mixmaster-spec\">Mixmaster</a> or <a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#minion-design\">Mixminion</a> to slow this attack. That's why Tor's security is all about trying to decrease the chances that an adversary will end up in the right positions to see the traffic flows.</p>\n<p>The way we generally explain it is that Tor tries to protect against <b>traffic analysis</b>, where an attacker tries to learn whom to investigate, but Tor can't protect against <b>traffic confirmation</b> (also known as <b>end-to-end correlation</b>), where an attacker tries to confirm a hypothesis by monitoring the right locations in the network and then doing the math.</p>\n<p>And the math is really effective. There are simple packet counting attacks (<a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#SS03\">Passive Attack Analysis for Connection-Based Anonymity Systems</a>) and moving window averages (<a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#timing-fc2004\">Timing Attacks in Low-Latency Mix-Based Systems</a>), but the more recent stuff is <a href=\"http://www.lightbluetouchpaper.org/2007/05/28/sampled-traffic-analysis-by-internet-exchange-level-adversaries/\">downright scary</a>, like Steven Murdoch's PET 2007 paper about achieving high confidence in a correlation attack despite seeing only 1 in 2000 packets on each side (<a href=\"http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#murdoch-pet2007\">Sampled Traffic Analysis by Internet-Exchange-Level Adversaries</a>).\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Second, there's some further discussion about the efficacy of traffic correlation attacks at scale in the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters\">Improving Tor's anonymity by changing guard parameters</a> analysis:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nTariq's paper makes two simplifying assumptions when calling an attack successful [...] 2) He assumes that the end-to-end correlation attack (matching up the incoming flow to the outgoing flow) is instantaneous and perfect. [...] The second one (\"how successful is the correlation attack at scale?\" or maybe better, \"how do the false positives in the correlation attack compare to the false negatives?\") remains an open research question.</p>\n<p>Researchers generally agree that given a handful of traffic flows, it's easy to match them up. But what about the millions of traffic flows we have now? What levels of false positives (algorithm says \"match!\" when it's wrong) are acceptable to this attacker? Are there some simple, not too burdensome, tricks we can do to drive up the false positives rates, even if we all agree that those tricks wouldn't work in the \"just looking at a handful of flows\" case?</p>\n<p>More precisely, it's possible that correlation attacks don't scale well because as the number of Tor clients grows, the chance that the exit stream actually came from a different Tor client (not the one you're watching) grows. So the confidence in your match needs to grow along with that or your false positive rate will explode. The people who say that correlation attacks don't scale use phrases like \"say your correlation attack is 99.9% accurate\" when arguing it. The folks who think it does scale use phrases like \"I can easily make my correlation attack arbitrarily accurate.\" My hope is that the reality is somewhere in between &mdash; correlation attacks in the current Tor network can probably be made plenty accurate, but perhaps with some simple design changes we can improve the situation.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>The discussion of false positives is key to this new paper too: Sambuddho's paper mentions a false positive rate of 6%. That sounds like it means if you see a traffic flow at one side of the Tor network, and you have a set of 100000 flows on the other side and you're trying to find the match, then 6000 of those flows will look like a match. It's easy to see how at scale, this \"base rate fallacy\" problem could make the attack effectively useless.</p>\n<p>And that high false positive rate is not at all surprising, since he is trying to capture only a summary of the flows at each side and then do the correlation using only those summaries. It would be neat (in a theoretical sense) to learn that it works, but it seems to me that there's a lot of work left here in showing that it would work in practice. It also seems likely that his definition of false positive rate and my use of it above don't line up completely: it would be great if somebody here could work on reconciling them.</p>\n<p>For a possibly related case where a series of academic research papers misunderstood the base rate fallacy and came to bad conclusions, see <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/critique-website-traffic-fingerprinting-attacks\">Mike's critique of website fingerprinting attacks</a> plus the <a href=\"https://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sa499/papers/ccs-webfp-final.pdf\">follow-up paper from CCS this year confirming that he's right</a>.</p>\n<p>I should also emphasize that whether this attack can be performed at all has to do with how much of the Internet the adversary is able to measure or control. This diversity question is a large and important one, with lots of attention already. See <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/improving-tors-anonymity-changing-guard-parameters#fix4\">more discussion here</a>.</p>\n<p>In summary, it's great to see more research on traffic confirmation attacks, but a) traffic confirmation attacks are not a new area so don't freak out without actually reading the papers, and b) this particular one, while kind of neat, doesn't supercede all the previous papers.</p>\n<p>(I should put in an addendum here for the people who are wondering if everything they read on the Internet in a given week is surely all tied together: we don't have any reason to think that this attack, or one like it, is related to the recent arrests of <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/thoughts-and-concerns-about-operation-onymous\">a few dozen people</a> around the world. So far, all indications are that those arrests are best explained by bad opsec for a few of them, and then those few pointed to the others when they were questioned.)</p>\n<p>[Edit: be sure to read Sambuddho's comment below, too. -RD]</p>"

    "content": "<p>We are planning to discontinue support for 32 bit Macs for Tor Browser.</p>\n<p>We're doing this for two main reasons. First, Apple itself no longer supports 32 bit Macs. The only remaining 32 bit Mac users are on OSX 10.6, which Apple ended support for in <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/03/snow-leopard-updates-are-probably-done-here-are-your-os-x-upgrade-options/\">February of this year</a>. Second, 64 bit software has improved security properties by way of improved address space layout randomization (ASLR), which makes exploitation more difficult.</p>\n<p>This transition will happen in phases: First, the upcoming 4.5-alpha series will only be available as 64 bit builds. We will continue releasing 32 bit versions of the 4.0 series until the 4.5 series is declared stable. When the 4.5 release stabilizes, all support for 32 bit Macs will end. The 4.5 release series will be stable \"when it's ready\", but we know we need to perform at least two more releases in this series to properly exercise the new security features in the updater. This means that 32 bit Mac users likely have a month or two to decide what to do.</p>\n<p>Current 32 bit Mac users have a few options. If your actual Mac hardware is 64 bit capable, you can upgrade to either the 64 bit edition of OSX 10.6 (which we will continue to support for a bit longer), or use the app store to upgrade to 10.9 or 10.10.</p>\n<p>If your hardware is not 64 bit capable and won't run these newer Mac operating systems, you should still be able to use <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/download/index.en.html\">Tails</a>, which contains the Tor Browser. You can run Tails in a virtual machine such as <a href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/\">VirtualBox</a>, or you can <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/installation/manual/mac/index.en.html\">manually install it to a USB disk from the Mac OS Terminal</a>. If you install Tails to a USB stick, you will need to <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/start_tails/index.en.html#index2h2\">reboot your Mac</a> in order to use it.</p>\n<p><a name=\"updating\"></a><br />\n<h1>All Mac Users: Manual Update Required</h1>\n<p>The transition from 32 bit Mac bundles to 64 bit Mac bundles means that our (currently experimental) in-browser updater will not transition any Mac users to the 64bit version automatically, even if your Mac is already running a 64 bit version of Mac OS. You must perform this update manually, as you had to do prior to the 4.0 series. This means downloading <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html#mac\">the DMG</a> and dragging the new 64 bit Tor Browser over your old Tor Browser, and replacing the application.</p>\n<p>Once you are running the 64 bit version, updates should function correctly again.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the forty-sixth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser 4.5-alpha-1 is out</h1>\n<p>Mike Perry <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-45-alpha-1-released\">announced</a> the first alpha release in the Tor Browser 4.5 series. This version goes some way to restoring one of the features most missed by users following the removal of the now-defunct Vidalia interface from Tor Browser — the ability to quickly visualize the Tor circuit that the current page is using. Clicking on the green Torbutton icon in the Tor Browser window now brings up a small diagram showing the IP addresses of all relays in a circuit, and the states in which they are located; this may help users evaluate the suitability of the circuits their Tor has selected, and also to quickly identify a malicious exit relay if they notice unusual behavior in downloaded pages and files.</p>\n<p>Another key user-facing innovation in this release is the “security slider”. Users can now choose from four security settings in Torbutton’s “Preferences” window — “low (default)”, “medium-low”, “medium-high”, and “high” — that allow them to customize their Tor Browser based on their own security and usability needs, while still working to prevent “partitioning” attacks, which try to identify users based on their unusual browser configuration.</p>\n<p>For other important additions in this series, please see the full changelog in Mike’s post. If you want to try out this alpha version, you can find it on the Tor Browser <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html#downloads-alpha\">project page</a> or in the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/4.5-alpha-1/\">distribution directory</a>; please report any bugs you find!</p>\n<h1>Tor Browser on 32-bit Macs approaches end-of-life</h1>\n<p>Now that Apple has discontinued support for the last remaining 32-bit Mac systems, Mike Perry <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/end-life-plan-tor-browser-32-bit-macs\">announced</a> that the Tor Browser team will soon stop distributing 32-bit builds of its software. This week’s 4.5-alpha-1, like all future releases in the 4.5 series, is only available in a 64-bit build, and all support for 32-bit systems will end once 4.5 supersedes 4.0.</p>\n<p>“32-bit Mac users likely have a month or two to decide what to do”, wrote Mike. “If your actual Mac hardware is 64-bit capable, you can upgrade to either the 64-bit edition of OSX 10.6 (which we will continue to support for a bit longer), or use the app store to upgrade to 10.9 or 10.10.

But it’s also important to realize that traffic correlation attacks are not a new area”, wrote Roger.</p>\n<p>The Tails team set out the December <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-November/007422.html\">release schedule</a> for version 1.2.1 of the anonymous live operating system.</p>\n<p>Giovanni Pellerano <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-November/035742.html\">announced</a> version 3.1.30 of Tor2web, which now supports web access to Tor hidden services over TLS. Access to the Facebook hidden service, the most high-profile instance of an HTTPS-enabled .onion site, is blocked in this version, as Tor2web offers no benefit in cases where there exists an identical service on the regular or “naked” web, and may actually present additional risk of compromise.</p>\n<p>Griffin Boyce <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007798.html\">requested feedback</a> on a “very rough” version of <a href=\"https://github.com/glamrock/Stormy\">Stormy</a>, the simple hidden service setup wizard. “I’d love to get feedback on places where it breaks and where it could use a major structural change […] the current setup is entirely for development and should not be used as-is.”</p>\n<p>Virgil Griffith <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-November/035658.html\">started a discussion</a> on the suitability of the name “hidden services” as opposed to other possible terms like “onion service” or “onion site”. Among the many responses, Roger Dingledine <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-November/035660.html\">suggested</a> that an alternative name like “onion service” “makes people have to learn what it is rather than guessing (and often guessing wrong)”, while Nathan Freitas <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-November/035662.html\">pointed out</a> that as “typical users don’t talk about web services, they talk about web sites or pages”, “onion site” might be a term worth adopting.</p>\n<p>Tom Ritter <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007786.html\">put forward</a> a number of improvements to the integration of HTTPS certificates and hidden services, following “a spirited debate on IRC”.</p>\n<p>The Wikimedia Foundation is the latest high-profile organization to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-November/035655.html\">set up a non-exit Tor relay</a>. “It’s just a small contribution to the network.

This is one study on the subject in a controlled environment using one readily available traffic monitoring technology to analyze Tor traffic. The researcher has clarified in the media that it was only 81.4 percent of their experiments not “81 percent of all Tor traffic” as has been reported elsewhere.</p>\n<p>The Tor network provides anonymity by routing the user’s information through multiple servers (usually three) so that it is hard to detect the person’s physical location. </p>\n<p>Tor protects users by:<br />\n1) encryption to ensure privacy of data within the Tor network,<br />\n2) authentication so clients know they're talking to the relays they meant to talk to, and<br />\n3) signatures to make sure all clients know the same set of relays.</p>\n<p>In theory it may be possible to track Tor users by linking up their entry and exit points on the network but it is generally very difficult to do so.  The Tor network design, however, does not protect against a targeted attack by a global passive adversary  (such as the NSA) intent on figuring out whom to investigate through watching and measuring Tor traffic going into and out of the network and correlating the information on both sides. We encourage you to learn more about <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en#warning\" rel=\"nofollow\">what Tor does</a>  provide.</p>\n<p>Tor is used by 2.5 million people a day including the general public, journalists, companies, activists, military, and law enforcement and is a very safe, reliable way to protect your privacy on the Internet.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Hello people. It's been a while since Google Summer of Code 2014 ended, but I wanted to give you a brief review of the work done on GetTor.<br />\n<br><br />\n<strong>What is GetTor?</strong></p>\n<p>GetTor is a program that serves Tor Browser over email. In the past, people would make requests by sending emails to GetTor, which would send back Tor Browser as email attachments. In <strong>highly censored</strong> countries (and places) where the Tor Project website is blocked, GetTor would be a convenient way for people to get access to Tor Browser. </p>\n<p>There were lots of nice features incorporated in GetTor, such as specifying the operating system and language for the package wanted, or sending delay messages to let people know the package was on its way. But Tor Browser started to get larger in size (over 25 MB), to the point where it wasn't longer possible to send it via most email providers.<br />\n<br><br />\n<strong>Revamp</strong></p>\n<p>It wasn't long until a solution for this problem came up. The idea consisted on uploading Tor Browser to the cloud (Dropbox) and when someone asked for it via GetTor, a reply with the links for download was sent. This worked quite well, but the fix was far from being complete and at that point the whole GetTor was in need of some love to get back to its shiny days.<br />\n<br><br />\n<strong>Google Summer of Code</strong></p>\n<p>All of what I mentioned was listed on the Volunteer page of the Tor Project website, so when I got there looking for a project to work on for the Google Summer of Code, I immediatly considered it into my options, because of the <em>social impact</em> of GetTor as for the technical skills required. I was happy to learn that my proposal got accepted and I was one of the fourteen students selected to work on the Tor Project during the northern hemisphere summer (actually, it was winter here in Chile). </p>\n<p>First, I started to work on the design, making sure that when I started to code, most of the ideas I would be implementing were carefully described and discussed. Of course, a lot of things did change over the coding period, some of them small stuff like how the links would be internally stored by GetTor, and some of them not so small, like changing one of the distribution modules. </p>\n<p>Anyhow, I don't want to bore you with  technical details here, but if you're interested, please read my <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/gsoc\">biweekly reports</a> and check the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/gettor.git/tree/?h=revamp\">code repository</a>.<br />\n<br><br />\n<strong>Outcome</strong></p>\n<p>The coding period lasted a little more than three months, and I managed to pass both mid-term and final evaluations. But more importantly, the status of GetTor improved significantly during that time. I did a <em>full rewrite</em> of it, focusing on having clean and readable code, and on making it easy to add new distribution modules and cloud providers for storing Tor Browser. Two distribution modules were successfully finished: SMTP, for asking via email; and XMPP, for asking via Jabber (you know, chat style).</p>\n<p>Even though the new GetTor is able to manage requests in multiple locales, for now the SMTP module has been deployed with support for English requests only; other locales and modules will eventually/gradually be supported. We will let you know when that happens (<em>soon</em> we hope!).</p>\n<p>Almost all of the testing and other minor fixes were done after the Google Summer of Code ended, and this is because I explicitly mentioned to my mentors that I have the intention to keep working on it and to continue as the lead developer if needed. It's not just for the work I did, but more importantly for the possibility of <em>helping other people</em>, specially those that have the bad fortune to live under regimes and/or organizations which think they can impose control on the information you can access, spy on what you do and chase you for what you think. If I have the chance to help avoiding this dystopia, as little as I can, I would certainly do whatever is in my hands, and I invite you to do the same.<br />\n<br><br />\n<strong>Great, but how do I use it?</strong></p>\n<p>You can reach GetTor by sending emails to <strong>gettor@torproject.org</strong>. To ask for Tor Browser, you just have to send an email with the word <strong>windows</strong> in the body to get it for Windows, <strong>osx</strong> to get it for Mac OSX, or <strong>linux</strong> to get it for Linux. The options are case insentitive, so it doesn't matter if you send <em>Linux</em>, or <em>linux</em>, or <em>LiNuX</em>, as long as it describes one of the options mentioned before; if you send anything different from that, you will receive a help message with detailed instructions on how to interact with it. Once you ask for Tor Browser, GetTor will reply to you with Dropbox links to download the required package for your architecture (32/64 bit) and operating system, along with some extra information to help you verify the integrity of the downloaded files. Please note that you can reach GetTor from <strong>any</strong> email address: gmail, yahoo, hotmail, riseup, etc. The only restriction is that you can do a maximum of three requests in a row, after that you'll have to wait 20 minutes to reach GetTor again. You can find out more about its purpose and how it works <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/gettor.html\">here</a>.<br />\n<br><br />\n<strong>Collaborate</strong></p>\n<p>The main way to collaborate is to use GetTor and provide <strong>feedback</strong>! Please tell us what you like, what you don't like, what works smoothly and what doesn't work or could work better; after all, GetTor is here for <strong>you</strong>, so you should tell us what we need to do :) For this, please open a ticket on the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor\">trac system</a> under the GetTor component. You can file anything from usability suggestions/bugs to new development ideas.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I've read lots of people who are interested to collaborate with the Tor Project and they just don't know where to start or they are looking for something easy to collaborate with. The code and work on GetTor is quite straightforward, so if you know some Python and have some free time that you feel you want to give to an awesome <strong>open source</strong> organization, check the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/gettor.git/tree/?h=revamp\">git repository</a> and the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?status=accepted&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=needs_information&amp;status=needs_review&amp;status=needs_revision&amp;status=new&amp;status=reopened&amp;component=GetTor&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=component&amp;col=status&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority\">tickets</a> and you might find something easy to start with. There are various ideas and things left to do in GetTor, so please join us!<br />\n<br><br />\n<strong>Other options</strong></p>\n<p>It's important to note that there are a couple more options to obtain Tor Browser when you cannot access Tor Project's website. The first and easiest is to access the official mirrors: <a href=\"https://tor.eff.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en\">EFF</a> and <a href=\"https://www.torservers.net/mirrors/torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en\">torservers.net</a>. If those sites are blocked too, you can try using <a href=\"https://github.com/glamrock/satori\">Satori</a>, an app for Google Chrome that distributes various circumvention tools in a difficult-to-block way, making it easy for users to check if the software has been tampered. If after all, you manage to get the Tor Browser but you are not able to reach the Tor network, you might want to use bridges or the pluggable transports. You can read more about that <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ways-get-tor-browser-bundle\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://bridges.torproject.org/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/pluggable-transports.html.en\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><br><br />\n<strong>Thanks</strong></p>\n<p>I want to end this blog post by thanking to the Tor Project organization in general for letting me be part of it during the summer and kindly answer any doubt that came up, and to <em>Sukhbir</em> and <em>Nima</em> in particular for their awesome job as mentors, I couldn't have done it without you, thanks a lot guys!<br />\n<br></p>"

Although performance is not yet affected, these changes could form the basis of other improvements to managing congestion caused by “mismanaged socket output” in the Tor network, as discussed by Jansen et al. in “<a href=\"http://www.robgjansen.com/publications/kist-sec2014.pdf\">Never Been KIST</a>”.</p>\n<p>Following a discussion with David Goulet, Nick Mathewson posted a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007898.html\">draft proposal</a> of possible improvements to integration testing for Tor.</p>\n<p>Sebastian Hahn <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007892.html\">informed</a> users of the Tor Project’s git repositories that cloning via the unauthenticated git:// protocol is no longer supported — secure https:// access has been and still is the preferred method for retrieving code.</p>\n<p>Gareth Owen started a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007870.html\">discussion</a> of suspicious relay behaviors that automated Tor network tests could scan for, in addition to those that are already monitored.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>The help desk has been asked how to set up a relay on a Windows laptop. We don’t recommend running a relay on a laptop: the relays that are most useful to the network have faster bandwidth than most home internet connections can offer. Relays also need to have as much uptime as possible, and a laptop that gets put to sleep and woken up once a week or more is not a good computing environment for a relay that should serve the network in a consistent way.</p>\n<p>We are not able to provide much help to users who report errors when using any of the Vidalia bundles, as Vidalia is no longer maintained.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Matt Pagan, Nick Mathewson, Roger Dingledine, and Harmony.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

You can obtain your copy from the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html\">project page</a>, or through the in-browser updater.</p>\n<h1>Tails 1.2.1 is out</h1>\n<p>The Tails team <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.2.1/\">announced</a> a new version of the amnesic live operating system. Alongside updates to Linux and Tor Browser, Tails 1.2.1 finally disables the Truecrypt encryption manager, which was abandoned by its developers earlier this year. There have been warnings about this change for several months, but users who have not yet migrated their data away from Truecrypt (or who are not able to) can still access these volumes with cryptsetup by following <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/doc/encryption_and_privacy/truecrypt/\">Tails’ own guide</a>.</p>\n<p>The default configuration of GnuPG has also been changed in line with <a href=\"https://help.riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices\">accepted best practices</a>. If you want to take advantage of this, there is a simple step you need to perform; please see the team’s post for more details, and get your copy of the new Tails from the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/download/\">download page</a> or through the incremental updater.</p>\n<h1>More monthly status reports for November 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of November continued, with reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000718.html\">Pearl Crescent</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000719.html\">Sukhbir Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000720.html\">Leiah Jansen</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000721.html\">Matt Pagan</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000723.html\">Arlo Breault</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000724.html\">Colin C.</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000725.html\">Nicolas Vigier</a>.</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing reported on behalf of the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000722.html\">Tor Network Tools team</a>, and Roger Dingledine sent out the report for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000726.html\">SponsorF</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>George Kadianakis <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007928.html\">sent out</a> an updated draft of the proposal to safely collect hidden service statistics from Tor relays.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson gave a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIf_VZQr-dw\">talk</a> to the Computer Systems Security class at MIT on the subject of “Anonymous Communication”.</p>\n<p>David Fifield <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007916.html\">summarized</a> the costs incurred in November by the infrastructure for the meek pluggable transport.</p>\n<p>The Tails team <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-December/007580.html\">wondered</a> about the best way to prioritize adding support for pluggable transports: “Assuming we add support for Scramblesuit in Tails 1.3, then what usecases won’t we be supporting, that we could support better with obfs4 or meek?”</p>\n<p>usprey wrote up a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-December/005907.html\">guide</a> to configuring a Tor relay on a server running Arch Linux: “All and any feedback will be appreciated!

    "content": "<p>One of our colleagues has been the target of a sustained campaign of harassment for the past several months. We have decided to publish this statement to publicly declare our support for her, for every member of our organization, and for every member of our community who experiences this harassment. She is not alone and her experience has catalyzed us to action. This statement is a start.</p>\n<p>The Tor Project works to create ways to bypass censorship and ensure anonymity on the Internet. <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers\">Our software is used</a> by journalists, human rights defenders, members of law enforcement, diplomatic officials, and many others. We do high-profile work, and over the past years, many of us have been the targets of online harassment. The current incidents come at a time when suspicion, slander, and threats are endemic to the online world. They create an environment where the malicious feel safe and the misguided feel justified in striking out online with a thousand blows. Under such attacks, many people have suffered &mdash; especially women who speak up online. Women who work on Tor are targeted, degraded, minimized and endure serious, frightening threats.</p>\n<p>This is the status quo for a large part of the internet. We will not accept it.</p>\n<p>We work on anonymity technology because we believe in empowering people. This empowerment is the beginning and a means, not the end of the discussion. Each person who has power to speak freely on the net also has the power to hurt and harm. Merely because one is free to say a thing does not mean that it should be tolerated or considered reasonable. Our commitment to building and promoting strong anonymity technology is absolute. We have decided that it is not enough for us to work to protect the world from snoops and censors; we must also stand up to protect one another from harassment.</p>\n<p>It's true that we ourselves are far from perfect. Some of us have written thoughtless things about members of our own community, have judged prematurely, or conflated an idea we hated with the person holding it. Therefore, in categorically condemning the urge to harass, we mean categorically: we will neither tolerate it in others, nor will we accept it among ourselves. We are dedicated to both protecting our employees and colleagues from violence, and trying to foster more positive and mindful behavior online ourselves.</p>\n<p>Further, we will no longer hold back out of fear or uncertainty from an opportunity to defend a member of our community online. We write tools to provide online freedom but we don't endorse online or offline abuse. Similarly, in the offline world, we support freedom of speech but we oppose the abuse and harassment of women and others. We know that online harassment is one small piece of the larger struggle that women, people of color, and others face against sexism, racism, homophobia and other bigotry. </p>\n<p>This declaration is not the last word, but a beginning: We will not tolerate harassment of our people. We are working within our community to devise ways to concretely support people who suffer from online harassment; this statement is part of that discussion. We hope it will contribute to the larger public conversation about online harassment and we encourage other organizations to sign on to it or write one of their own.</p>\n<p>For questions about Tor, its work, its staff, its funding, or its world view, we encourage people to directly contact us (Media contact: Kate Krauss, press @ torproject.org).

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the fiftieth issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Solidarity against online harassment</h1>\n<p>Following “a sustained campaign of harassment” directed at a core Tor developer over the past few months, the Tor Project published a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/solidarity-against-online-harassment\">statement</a> in which it declared “support for her, for every member of our organization, and for every member of our community who experiences this harassment”: “In categorically condemning the urge to harass, we mean categorically: we will neither tolerate it in others, nor will we accept it among ourselves. We are dedicated to both protecting our employees and colleagues from violence, and trying to foster more positive and mindful behavior online ourselves… We are working within our community to devise ways to concretely support people who suffer from online harassment; this statement is part of that discussion. We hope it will contribute to the larger public conversation about online harassment and we encourage other organizations to sign on to it or write one of their own.”</p>\n<p>As of this writing, there are 448 signatories to the statement, including Tor developers and community members, academics, journalists, lawyers, and many others who are lending their support to this movement in its early stages. If you want to add your name to the list, please send an email to <a href=\"mailto:tor-assistants@lists.torproject.org\">tor-assistants@lists.torproject.org</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tails 1.2.2 is out</h1>\n<p>The Tails team <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.2.2/\">announced</a> a pointfix release of the amnesic live operating system. The only difference between this version and the recent 1.2.1 release is that the automatic Tails Updater now expects a different certificate authority when checking for a new Tails version. As the team explained, “On January 3rd, the SSL certificate of our website hosting provider, boum.org, will expire. The new certificate will be issued by a different certificate authority […] As a consequence, versions previous to 1.2.2 won’t be able to do the next automatic upgrade to version 1.2.3 and will receive an error message from Tails Upgrader when starting Tails after January 3rd”.</p>\n<p>This, along with a <a href=\"https://labs.riseup.net/code/issues/8449\">bug</a> that prevents automatic updates from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2, means that all Tails users will need to upgrade manually: either to version 1.2.2 before January 3rd or (if for some reason that is not possible) to version 1.2.3 following its release on January 14th. Please see the team’s post for more details and download instructions.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>George Kadianakis, Karsten Loesing, Aaron Johnson, and David Goulet <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007968.html\">requested feedback</a> on the design and code they have developed for the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/karsten/tor.git/log/?h=task-13192-5\">Tor branch</a> that will enable the collection of statistics on Tor hidden services, hoping to answer the questions “Approximately how many hidden services are there?” and “Approximately how much traffic in the Tor network is going to hidden services?”: “Our plan is that in approximately a week we will ask volunteers to run the branch. Then in a month from now we will use those stats to write a blog post about the approximate size of Tor hidden services network and the approximate traffic it’s pushing.” Please join in with your comments on the relevant <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13192\">ticket</a>!</p>\n<p>Philipp Winter <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007973.html\">announced</a> an early version of “zoossh”, which as the name implies is a speedy parser written in Go that will help to “detect sybils and other anomalies in the Tor network” by examining Tor’s archive of network data. While it is not quite ready for use, “I wanted folks to know that I’m working on that and I’m always happy to get feedback and patches.”</p>\n<p>Yawning Angel <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007977.html\">announced</a> the existence of “basket”, a “stab at designing something that significantly increases Tor’s resistance to upcoming/future attacks”, combining post-quantum cryptographic primitives with “defenses against website fingerprinting (and possibly end-to-end correlation) attacks”. You can read full details of the cryptographic and other features of “basket” in Yawning’s post, which is replete with warnings against using the software at this stage: “It’s almost at the point where brave members of the general public should be aware that it exists as a potential option in the privacy toolbox… [but] seriously, unless you are a developer or researcher, you REALLY SHOULD NOT use ‘basket’.” If you are gifted or foolhardy enough to ignore Yawning’s advice and test “basket” for yourself, please let the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-dev\">tor-dev mailing list</a> know what you find.</p>\n<p>Sukhbir Singh and Arlo Breault <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007981.html\">requested feedback</a> on an alpha version of Tor Messenger. It is an instant messaging client currently under development that intends to send all traffic over Tor, use Off-the-Record (OTR) encryption of conversations by default, work with a wide variety of chat networks, and have an easy-to-use graphical user interface localized into multiple languages.</p>\n<p>TheCthulhu announced that his mirrors of two Tor network tools are now <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-December/035982.html\">available over Tor hidden services</a>. <a href=\"https://globe.thecthulhu.com\">Globe</a> can be accessed via <a href=\"http://globe223ezvh6bps.onion\" title=\"http://globe223ezvh6bps.onion\">http://globe223ezvh6bps.onion</a> and <a href=\"https://atlas.thecthulhu.com\">Atlas</a> via <a href=\"http://atlas777hhh7mcs7.onion\" title=\"http://atlas777hhh7mcs7.onion\">http://atlas777hhh7mcs7.onion</a>. The mirrors provided by the Cthulhu run on their own instance of Onionoo, so in the event that the primary sites hosted by Tor Project are offline, both of these new mirrors should still be available for use either through the new hidden services or through regular clearnet access.</p>\n<p>The Tails team <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2014-December/007632.html\">published</a> a signed list of SHA256 hashes for every version of Tails (and its predecessor, amnesia) that it had either built or verified at the time of release.</p>\n<p>Vlad Tsyrklevich <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007957.html\">raised</a> the issue of the discoverability risk posed to Tor bridges by the default setting of their ORPorts to 443 or 9001. Using data from Onionoo and internet-wide scans, Vlad found that “there are 4267 bridges, of which 1819 serve their ORPort on port 443 and 383 serve on port 9001. That’s 52% of tor bridges. There are 1926 pluggable-transports enabled bridges, 316 with ORPort 443 and 33 with ORPort 9001. That’s 18% of Tor bridges… I realized I was also discovering a fair amount of private bridges not included in the Onionoo data set.” Vlad recommended that operators be warned to change their ORPorts away from the default; Aaron Johnson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007959.html\">suggested</a> possible alternative solutions, and Philipp Winter <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007963.html\">remarked</a> that while bridges on port 443 “would easily fall prey to Internet-wide scanning”, “they would still be useful for users behind captive portals” and other adversaries that restrict connections to a limited range of ports.</p>\n<p>Alden Page <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-December/035989.html\">announced</a> that development will soon begin on a free-software tool to counteract “stylometry” attacks, which attempt to deanonymize the author of a piece of text based on their writing style alone. “I hope you will all agree that this poses a significant threat to the preservation of the anonymity of Tor users”, wrote Alden. “In the spirit of meeting the needs of the privacy community, I am interested in hearing what potential users might have to say about the design of such a tool.” Please see Alden’s post for further discussion of stylometry attacks and the proposed countermeasures, and feel free to respond with your comments or questions.</p>\n<h1>Tor help desk roundup</h1>\n<p>Because Tor Browser prevents users from running it as root, Kali Linux users starting Tor Browser will see an error message saying Tor should not be run as root. </p>\n<p>In Kali, all userspace software runs as root by default. To run Tor Browser in Kali Linux, create a new user account just for using Tor Browser. Unpack Tor Browser and chown -R your whole Tor Browser directory. Run Tor Browser as your created Tor Browser user account.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Harmony, TheCthulhu, Matt Pagan, Arlo Breault, and Karsten Loesing.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN? Please help us create this newsletter. We still need more volunteers to watch the Tor community and report important news.

    "content": "<p>The Tor Project has learned that there may be an attempt to incapacitate our network in the next few days through the seizure of specialized servers in the network called directory authorities. (<a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#KeyManagement\">Directory authorities</a> help Tor clients learn the list of <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/overview#thesolution\">relays</a> that make up the Tor network.) We are taking steps now to ensure the safety of our users, and our system is already built to be redundant so that users maintain anonymity even if the network is attacked. Tor remains safe to use.</p>\n<p>We hope that this attack doesn't occur; Tor is used by many good people. If the network is affected, we will immediately inform users via <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/\">this blog</a> and our Twitter feed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TorProject\">@TorProject</a>, along with more information if we become aware of any related risks to Tor users.</p>\n<p>The Tor network provides a safe haven from surveillance, censorship, and computer network exploitation for millions of people who live in repressive regimes, including human rights activists in countries such as Iran, Syria, and Russia.  People use the Tor network every day to conduct their daily business without fear that their online activities and speech (Facebook posts, email, Twitter feeds) will be tracked and used against them later. Millions more also use the Tor network at their local internet cafe to stay safe for ordinary web browsing.</p>\n<p>Tor is also used by banks, diplomatic officials, members of law enforcement, bloggers, and <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers#normalusers\">many others</a>. Attempts to disable the Tor network would interfere with all of these users, not just ones disliked by the attacker.</p>\n<p>Every person has the right to privacy. This right is a foundation of a democratic society. For example, if Members of the British Parliament or US Congress cannot share ideas and opinions free of government spying, then they cannot remain independent from other branches of government. If journalists are unable to keep their sources confidential, then the ability of the press to check the power of the government is compromised. If human rights workers can't report evidence of possible crimes against humanity, it is impossible for other bodies to examine this evidence and to react. In the service of justice, we believe that the answer is to open up communication lines for everyone, securely and anonymously.</p>\n<p>The Tor network provides online anonymity and privacy that allow freedom for everyone. Like freedom of speech, online privacy is a right for all.</p>\n<p>[Update Monday Dec 22: So far all is quiet on the directory authority front, and no news is good news.]<br />\n[Update Sunday Dec 28: Still quiet. This is good.]</p>"

    "content": "<p>Greetings wonderful people of the world! After months down in the engine room I'm delighted to announce the 1.3.0 release of Stem.</p>\n<p>For those who aren't familiar with it, Stem is a Python library for interacting with Tor. With it you can script against your relay, descriptor data, or even write applications similar to arm and Vidalia.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/\">https://stem.torproject.org/</a></b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>So what's new in this release?</p>\n<p>\n<hr /></p>\n<h2>Better Hidden Service Support</h2>\n<p>Now it's easier than ever to spin up hidden services!</p>\n<p>Thanks to contributions from Federico Ceratto and Patrick O'Doherty we now have a set of methods specifically for working with hidden services. Check it out in our new tutorial...</p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/tutorials/over_the_river.html\">Over the River and Through the Wood</a></b></p>\n<p>\n<hr /></p>\n<h2>Faster Descriptor Parsing</h2>\n<p>This release dramatically improves the speed at which Stem can parse decriptors. Thanks to optimizations from Nick Mathewson and Ossi Herrala we can now read descriptors 40% faster!</p>\n<p>\n<hr /></p>\n<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg. For a full rundown on the myriad of improvements and fixes in this release see...</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b><a href=\"https://stem.torproject.org/change_log.html#version-1-3\">https://stem.torproject.org/change_log.html#version-1-3</a></b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Cheers! -Damian</p>"

It also laid the long-obsolete Vidalia graphical controller to rest, replacing it with the faster, sleeker Tor Launcher. The privacy-preserving browser is now approaching version 4.5, and users can look forward to a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9387\">security slider</a> offering finer-grained tuning of security preferences, as well as features that restore some of Vidalia’s <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/8641\">circuit-visualization capabilities</a>.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Harmony and Karsten Loesing.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Hi, Nick here.</p>\n<p>Roger's at 31c3, so I'll post his statement about that article you might have seen:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nTor hidden service traffic, which Dr. Gareth Owen discussed in his talk this afternooon, is only 1.5% of all Tor traffic. Tor gets about 2 million users per day total.<br />\nThe researcher ran a set of Tor relays for a six month period, and recorded how many times somebody attempted to look up a hidden service (this lookup is one of the steps in visiting a hidden service). Then at the end of that period, he scanned the hidden services he'd learned about, to find out what sort of content was on them.</p>\n<p>Dr. Owen's data shows that there's a lot of churn in hidden services, so nearly all of the sites were gone by the time he did these scans. His graphs only show data about the sites that were still up many months later: so his data could either show a lot of people visiting abuse-related hidden services, or it could simply show that abuse-related hidden services are more long-lived than others. We can't tell from the data.</p>\n<p>Without knowing how many sites disappeared before he got around to looking at them, it's impossible to know what percentage of fetches went to abuse sites.</p>\n<p>There are important uses for hidden services, such as when human rights activists use them to access Facebook or to blog anonymously. These uses for hidden services are new and have great potential.</p>\n<p>PS: Law enforcement agencies use Tor to stay anonymous while they catch bad guys. Law enforcement agencies use and run hidden services, too.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>More info to follow.</p>"

    "content": "<p>Hi!  Nick here.</p>\n<p>I ought to post my own responses to that Andy Greenberg article, too.  (Especially since most everybody else around here is at <a href=\"http://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Static:Main_Page\">31c3</a> right now, or sick with the flu, or both.)</p>\n<p>When I saw the coverage of the hidden services study that was presented at CCC today, I was reminded of the media fallout from that old study from the 1990s that \"proved\" that a ridiculously high fraction of the internet was pornography...by looking at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet\">Usenet</a>*, and by counting newsgroups and bytes. (You might remember it; it was the basis of the delightful TIME Magazine <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19950703,00.html\">\"Cyberporn\" cover</a>.)</p>\n<p>The 1990s researcher wasn't lying outright, but he and the press *were* conflating one question: \"What fraction of Usenet groups are 'alt.sex' or 'alt.binaries' (file posting) groups\" with two others: \"What fraction of internet traffic is porn?\" and \"What fraction of internet-user hours are spent on porn?\"</p>\n<p>These are quite different things.</p>\n<p>The presentation today focused on data about hidden service types and usage. Predictably, given the results from <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.6768v2.pdf\">Biryukov, Pustogarov, Thill, and Weinmann</a>, the researcher found that hidden services related to child abuse are only a small fraction of the total number of hidden service addresses on the network. And because of the way that hidden services work, traffic does not go through hidden service directories, but instead through <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/rend-spec.txt\">rendezvous points</a> (randomly chosen Tor nodes): so no relay that knows the hidden service's address will learn the actual amount of traffic transmitted.  But, as previously documented, abusive services represent a disproportionate fraction of usage... if you're measuring usage with hidden service directory requests.</p>\n<p>Why might that be?</p>\n<p>First, some background. Basically, a Tor client makes a hidden service directory request the first time it visits a hidden service that it has not been to in a while.  (If you spend hours at one hidden service, you make about 1 hidden service directory request.  But if you spend 1 second each at 100 hidden services, you make about 100 requests.)  Therefore, obsessive users who visit many sites in a session account for many more of the requests that this study measures than users who visit a smaller number of sites with equal frequency.</p>\n<p>There are other confounding factors as well. Due to bugs in older Tor implementations, a hidden service that is unreliable (or completely unavailable) will get many, many more hidden service directory requests than a reliable one.  So if any abuse sites are unusually unreliable, we'd expect their users to create a disproportionately large number of hidden service directory requests.</p>\n<p>Also, a very large number of hidden service directory requests are probably not made by humans! See <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/13287\">bug 13287</a>: We don't know what's up with that. Could this be caused by some kind of anti-abuse organization running an automated scanning tool?</p>\n<p>In any case, a methodology that looks primarily at hidden service directory requests will over-rate services that are frequently accessed from a Tor client that hasn't been there recently, and under-rate services that are used via <a href=\"https://tor2web.org/\">tor2web</a>, and so on. It also depends a lot on how hidden services are configured, how frequently Tor hidden service directories go up and down, and what times of day they change introduction points in comparison to what time of day their users tend to be awake.</p>\n<p>The greater the number of distinct hidden services a person visits, and the less reliable those sites are, the more hidden service directory requests they will trigger.</p>\n<p>Suppose 10 people use hidden services to look at conspiracy theories, 100 people use hidden services to buy Cuban cigars, and 1000 people use it for online chat. </p>\n<p>But suppose that the average cigar purchaser visits only one or two sites to make purchases, and the average chat user joins one or two networks, whereas the average conspiracy theorist needs to visit several dozen forums and wikis. </p>\n<p>Suppose also that the average Cuban cigar purchaser makes about two purchases a month, the average chat user logs in once a day, and the average conspiracy theorist spends 3 hours a day crawling the hidden web.  </p>\n<p>And suppose that conspiracy theory websites come and go frequently, whereas cigar sites and chat networks are more stable. </p>\n<p>In this analysis, even though there are far more people buying cigars, users who use it for obsessive behavior that spans multiple unreliable hidden services will be far overrepresented in the count of hidden service directory requests than users who use it for activities done less frequently and across fewer services. So any comparison of hidden service directory request counts will say more about the behavioral differences of different types of users than about their relative numbers, or the amount of traffic they generated.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, let's spend a minute talking about freedom and philosophy.  Any system that provides security on the Internet will inevitably see some use by bad people that we'd rather not help at all.  After all, cars are used for getaways, and window shades conceal all kinds of criminality.  The only way to make a privacy tool that nobody abuses is to make it so weak that people aren't willing to touch it, or so unusable that nobody can figure it out. </p>\n<p>Up till now, many of the early adopters for Tor hidden services have been folks for whom the risk/effort calculations have been quite extreme, since--as I'd certainly acknowledge--the system isn't terribly usable for the average person as it stands.  Roger noted earlier that hidden services amount to less than 2% of our total traffic today.  Given their privacy potential, I think that's not even close to enough.  We've got to work over the next year or more to develop hidden services to the point where their positive impact is felt by the average netizen, whether they're publishing a personal blog for their friends, using a novel communications protocol more secure than email, or reading a news article based on information that a journalist received through an anonymous submission system.  Otherwise, they'll remain a target for every kind of speculation, and every misunderstanding about them will lead people to conclude the worst about privacy online.  <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/hidden-services-need-some-love\">Come lend a hand?</a></p>\n<p>(Also, no offense to Andy on this: he is a fine tech reporter and apparently a fine person. And no offense to Dr. Owen, who explained his results a lot more carefully than they have been re-explained elsewhere. Now please forgive me, I'm off to write some more software and get some sleep. Please direct all media inquiries to the email of \"press at torproject dot org\".)</p>\n<p>* Usenet was sort of like Twitter, only you could write paragraphs on it. ;)</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the final issue in 2014 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Attacks and rumors of attacks</h1>\n<p>Two weeks ago, the Tor Project relayed a <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/possible-upcoming-attempts-disable-tor-network\">warning</a> from an unspecified source to the effect that someone may have been preparing to seize, attack, or otherwise disable one or more of Tor’s <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/about.html#directory-authority\">directory authorities</a> in a bid to disrupt the entire Tor network. The lack of any specific information about the threat caused understandable concern in the Tor community, and several events that followed over the next fortnight did little to dispel this.</p>\n<p>First, the operator of a large Tor exit relay cluster <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-December/036067.html\">reported</a> that his servers may have been physically interfered with by unknown parties a short while before his message. Later <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2014-December/036084.html\">updates</a> suggested that foul play was less likely than initially thought.</p>\n<p>Several days later, a large number of small exit relays were created all at once, in what appeared to be a “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack\">Sybil attack</a>”; this was <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-consensus-health/2014-December/005381.html\">detected</a> and halted almost immediately, as was a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-consensus-health/2014-December/005414.html\">second, more recent incident</a>. As the Tor Project put it in a <a href=\"http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sjg365\">response</a>, “we don’t expect any anonymity or performance effects based on what we've seen so far”, although a side-effect of the countermeasure is that relays hosted on some IP ranges are currently being <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-December/006020.html\">rejected</a> by dirauths.</p>\n<p>As far as anyone can tell, these events are not related in any way to the initial warning. The Tor network has functioned normally throughout this period, and the appearance of a series of incidents is likely to be the result of coincidence (helped by the online rumor mill) rather than a coordinated campaign. It is never possible to say with certainty that attacks on the network will not occur, but the threat referred to in the original blog post has not yet materialized — and “no news is good news”.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Lasse Øverlier discovered that <a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/scramblesuit/\">ScrambleSuit</a>’s protection against “replay attacks”, in which an adversary repeats a client authentication event to learn that the server is in fact a ScrambleSuit bridge, doesn’t work. Philipp Winter <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/008019.html\">explained</a> the issue, and suggested some simple fixes.</p>\n<p>Tom van der Woerdt asked for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/008023.html\">review</a> of a <a href=\"https://github.com/TvdW/tor/commit/75b5d94eb976ee4998189dc69582c62511dde9eb\">patch</a> to remove the obsolete version 1 of Tor’s link protocol from the current software: “It’s a rather large patch, though not as large as the patch that will remove v2 of the protocol. However, before I write that one, can someone please check whether my patch is sane and I’m not violating any standards or policies?”</p>\n<p>David Fifield <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/12778#comment:5\">trimmed</a> the length of <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a>’s HTTP headers from 413 to 162 bytes, reducing the bandwidth it uses by “approximately” 3%.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2014-December/000815.html\">Kura</a> for running a mirror of the Tor Project website and software archive!</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Harmony, David Fifield, Chuck Peters, and Roger Dingledine.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

It introduces a major new backend for deciding when to send cells on channels, which should lead down the road to big performance increases. It contains security and statistics features for better work on hidden services, and numerous bugfixes. </p>\n<p>This release contains many new unit tests, along with major performance improvements for running testing networks using Chutney. Thanks to a series of patches contributed by \"teor\", testing networks should now bootstrap in seconds, rather than minutes. </p>\n<p>You can download the source from the usual place on the website. Packages should be up in a few days.</p>\n<p><b>NOTE:</b> This is an alpha release. Please expect bugs.</p>\n<h2>Changes in version 0.2.6.2-alpha - 2014-12-31</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Major features (relay, infrastructure):\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Complete revision of the code that relays use to decide which cell to send next. Formerly, we selected the best circuit to write on each channel, but we didn't select among channels in any sophisticated way. Now, we choose the best circuits globally from among those whose channels are ready to deliver traffic. </p>\n<p>This patch implements a new inter-cmux comparison API, a global high/low watermark mechanism and a global scheduler loop for transmission prioritization across all channels as well as among circuits on one channel. This schedule is currently tuned to (tolerantly) avoid making changes in network performance, but it should form the basis for major circuit performance increases in the future. Code by Andrea; tuning by Rob Jansen; implements ticket 9262. </p>\n</ul>\n<li>Major features (hidden services):\n<ul>\n<li>Make HS port scanning more difficult by immediately closing the circuit when a user attempts to connect to a nonexistent port. Closes ticket 13667.\n<li>Add a HiddenServiceStatistics option that allows Tor relays to gather and publish statistics about the overall size and volume of hidden service usage. Specifically, when this option is turned on, an HSDir will publish an approximate number of hidden services that have published descriptors to it the past 24 hours. Also, if a relay has acted as a hidden service rendezvous point, it will publish the approximate amount of rendezvous cells it has relayed the past 24 hours. The statistics themselves are obfuscated so that the exact values cannot be derived. For more details see proposal 238, \"Better hidden service stats from Tor relays\". This feature is currently disabled by default. Implements feature 13192.\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp; <span class='read-more'><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0262-alpha-released\"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the first issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor 0.2.6.2-alpha is out</h1>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0262-alpha-released\">announced</a> the second alpha release in the Tor 0.2.6.x series. As well as including the <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/9262\">cell scheduling changes</a> and <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13192\">hidden service statistics collection</a> reported in recent issues of TWN, this release makes it harder to portscan hidden services by closing circuits if a client tries to connect to a non-existent port. It also contains numerous bugfixes and new unit tests; please see Nick’s announcement for the full changelog. The source code is available as usual from the <a href=\"https://dist.torproject.org/\">distribution directory</a>.</p>\n<h1>Tor at 31c3</h1>\n<p>The 31st edition of the <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/wiki/Main_Page\">Chaos Communication Congress</a>, an annual highlight in the free software and security calendar, took place in Hamburg, and as usual Tor featured in several key talks over the course of the long weekend.</p>\n<p>Roger Dingledine and Jacob Appelbaum’s appropriately grand-sounding <a href=\"http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6251_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412301400_-_state_of_the_onion_-_jacob_-_arma.html\">“State of the Onion” address</a>, a round-up of the year’s events in the Tor community, took place once again, with guest contributions from journalist and filmmaker Laura Poitras and OONI developer Arturo Filastò. Topics included the relationship between censorship and surveillance, the misinterpretation of academic research by journalists, new pluggable transports, and much more.</p>\n<p>Laura Poitras also joined Julia Angwin, Jack Gillum, and Nadia Heninger for <a href=\"http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6154_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412272300_-_crypto_tales_from_the_trenches_-_nadia_heninger_-_julia_angwin_-_laura_poitras_-_jack_gillum.html\">“Crypto Tales from the Trenches”</a>, in which the journalists described their experiences with security software when doing research  and communicating with sources. “I don’t think any of us could do our work without Tor”, said Laura, while Julia described the Tails operating system as “her favorite success story” in this field.</p>\n<p>Tor Browser developer Mike Perry joined Seth Schoen to <a href=\"http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6240_-_en_-_saal_g_-_201412271400_-_reproducible_builds_-_mike_perry_-_seth_schoen_-_hans_steiner.html\">discuss</a> the concept of deterministic builds, the implementation of which has been one of the Tor Project’s major successes over the past year. Mike and Seth demonstrated some of the attacks that this system aims to defend against, as well as the work that Tor, F-Droid, and Debian have all been doing to make their processes compatible with the deterministic build process.</p>\n<p>Finally, Dr. Gareth Owen of Portsmouth University <a href=\"http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6112_-_en_-_saal_2_-_201412301715_-_tor_hidden_services_and_deanonymisation_-_dr_gareth_owen.html\">presented</a> the results of research into the content and usage of Tor hidden services. The research involved setting up a number of Tor relays, waiting until they gained the “HSDir” flag, then counting the number of times a particular service’s descriptor was requested, as well as manually categorizing the services whose descriptors were learned. Dr.  Owen found that while the largest category of onion services by number could be characterized as “drugs”, the majority of the descriptor requests he saw were for services in his “abuse” category. The talk itself discusses some possible limitations of the data gathered, and Tor developers have responded on the Tor blog with <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-80-percent-percent-1-2-percent-abusive\">further</a> <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/some-thoughts-hidden-services\">analysis</a>.</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for December 2014</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of December has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000727.html\">Philipp Winter</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000728.html\">Damian Johnson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000729.html\">Pearl Crescent</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000730.html\">Juha Nurmi</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000731.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2014-December/000732.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000733.html\">Sukhbir Singh</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000734.html\">Leiah Jansen</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000735.html\">David Goulet</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000736.html\">Michael Schloh von Bennewitz</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000738.html\">Colin C.</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000740.html\">Georg Koppen</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000742.html\">Arlo Breault</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000743.html\">George Kadianakis</a>.</p>\n<p>Colin C. also sent out the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000737.html\">help desk report</a>, while Arturo Filastò reported on behalf of the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000739.html\">OONI team</a> and Mike Perry for the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000741.html\">Tor Browser team</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Nick Mathewson and Andrea Shepard drafted a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-January/008087.html\">proposal</a> for including a hash chain in the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/about.html#consensus\">consensus</a> produced by Tor <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/about.html#directory-authority\">directory authorities</a>, in order to prevent certain kinds of attack on the directory authorities and their keys.</p>\n<p>Nick also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-January/036379.html\">clarified</a> that a recently-discovered Libevent vulnerability has no effect on Tor.</p>\n<p>In connection with the current push to collect statistics relating to Tor hidden services in a privacy-preserving manner, Aaron Johnson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-January/008086.html\">noted</a> that there are two further desirable sets of statistics which might pose a risk to anonymity if gathered incorrectly, and discussed possible solutions to the problem.</p>\n<p>David Fifield published a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-January/008082.html\">summary</a> of costs incurred by the meek pluggable transport for the month of December 2014.</p>\n<p>David also continued his experiments on historical Tor metrics data with <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-January/008095.html\">visualizations of a recent Sybil attack</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-January/036346.html\">wondered</a> what might have been responsible for a sudden change in the way that users in Kazakhstan were choosing to connect to the Tor network in October 2014.</p>\n<p>Sebastian Urbach <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2015-January/006051.html\">noted</a> a sudden drop in the number of Tor relays acting as hidden service directories, and wondered about the cause.

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the second issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>What to do if meek gets blocked</h1>\n<p>Regular readers of Tor Weekly News will be familiar with <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a>, the pluggable transport developed by David Fifield. Where most existing transports work by connecting clients to “bridge” relays that are difficult for the adversary to discover (or identify as relays), meek makes all of a client’s Tor traffic appear as though it is destined for a domain that is “too big to block” — in other words, web platforms so popular that a censor cannot prevent access to them without disrupting lots of unrelated Internet activity in its sphere of control — when in fact the traffic is sent to meek servers running on those platforms, which in turn relay it into the regular Tor network. Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are some of the services whose domain names currently work as disguises for meek.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean meek is unblockable. As David <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-January/036410.html\">wrote</a> to the tor-talk mailing list, “that’s the wrong way to think about the problem”. “It is designed to be difficult and expensive to block […] but suppose a censor makes that call, and blocks Google/Amazon/whatever. What then?”</p>\n<p>Two easy solutions are selecting a different backend (meek-amazon instead of meek-google, for example) or using a different DNS server: “The most common way to block a domain name is by DNS poisoning; i.e., the IP address behind the name is accessible, but the local DNS server gives you a false address. Try a public DNS server such as 8.8.8.8. But if that works, be aware that it’s probably only a temporary fix, as censors have historically figured out the alternate-DNS trick pretty fast.”</p>\n<p>“What you really want to do”, David suggested, “if the easy things don’t work, is choose a different front domain.” Please see David’s message for a fuller explanation of the difference between the backend and the “front domain”, and a guide to configuring new domains — as well as one to setting up your own meek web app, if all else fails.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>sycamoreone <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-January/036425.html\">announced</a> orc, a Go library that implements parts of Tor’s control protocol. “I do have some ideas for a higher-level interface, but no fixed plan yet. The next step will probably be to add net/http-like handlerFuncs to handle (asynchronous) replies from the onion router.”</p>\n<p>taxakis <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-January/036420.html\">linked</a> to “<a href=\"http://eprint.iacr.org/2015/008\">Post-Quantum Secure Onion Routing</a>” by Satrajit Ghosh and Aniket Kate, a new paper proposing a successor to the currently-used ntor handshake protocol that would be “resilient against quantum attacks, but also at the same time allow OR nodes to use the current DH public keys, and consequently require no modification to the current Tor public key infrastructure.” Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-January/036429.html\">wondered</a> whether “anybody around here has the cryptographic background to comment on the PQ part of their scheme?”, and compared it to Yawning Angel’s <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007977.html\">experimental “basket” protocol</a>.</p>\n<p>Nick also sent out a draft of <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-January/008115.html\">proposal 240</a>, describing “a simple way for directory authorities to perform signing key revocation”.</p>\n<p>Daniel Forster <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-January/008099.html\">asked</a> for advice on proposed research into splitting traffic over multiple entry guards in combination with traffic padding: “Is the approach heading in a not so great direction w.r.t. the Tor Project’s ‘only one entry node’ decision?”</p>\n<p>Karsten Loesing submitted his <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000744.html\">status report for December</a>, and George Kadianakis sent out the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000745.html\">report for SponsorR</a>.</p>\n<p>“After CCC I have a list of people that I have given raspberry pi’s with ooniprobe, and I would like to start coordinating with them via a mailing list”, wrote <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/14140\">Arturo Filastò</a>, and the result is the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ooni-operators\">ooni-operators mailing list</a>.

Christian Krbusek <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2015-January/000845.html\">clarified</a> that “in fact, you can’t prevent that, but you are also mirroring the signature files. So anybody downloading from any mirror — even the original host — should verify the downloads”. Andrew Lewman <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2015-January/000848.html\">added</a> that “the binaries are signed by well-known keys of tor packagers and developers. The mirror update script randomly selects a binary and verifies it each time it runs. If the binaries don't match, the mirror is removed from the public list.”</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Harmony.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

Nik also asked for suggestions on how to take the project forward: “Whether or not I continue hacking on oppy to make it a solid piece of software (rather than just a prototype) or just leave it as is as a reference depends on whether or not the Tor development community sees any real uses or future potential for the project”.</p>\n<p>meejah <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-January/008166.html\">announced</a> a new one-to-one encrypted and anonymous voice chat feature for “<a href=\"https://github.com/meejah/carml.git\">carml</a>”, the command-line Tor control utility: “ [It] essentially cross-connects the mic + speakers of each side via an Opus + OGG stream over a single Tor TCP connection.” As meejah warns, it is “NOT FOR REAL USE at all yet”, but if you have experience with gstreamer and/or OGG then please see meejah’s message for some unresolved questions.</p>\n<p>Following suggestions from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2015-January/006240.html\">Sebastian Urbach</a> and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2015-January/006248.html\">grarpamp</a>, Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/14257\">altered</a> the main unit of data rate measurement for the <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/\">Tor Metrics portal</a> from MiB/s (mebibytes per second) to the more common Gbit/s (gigabits per second).</p>\n<p>Philipp Winter <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-January/008156.html\">published</a> preliminary statistics and analysis obtained by running a Go implementation of <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/doctor.git/\">Doctor</a>’s sybil-hunting script over archived consensuses: “I’ll have a more detailed analysis at some point in the future.”</p>\n<p>The Tails team <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-January/007919.html\">published</a> instructions for running an nginx webserver as a hidden service using a copy of Tails: “Feedback is welcome!”</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2015-January/000850.html\">Frédéric Cornu</a> for running a mirror of the Tor Project’s website and software!</p>\n<h1>This week in Tor history</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-news/2014-January/000029.html\">A year ago this week</a>, the “<a href=\"http://www.cs.kau.se/philwint/spoiled_onions/\">Spoiled Onions</a>” project published its preliminary technical report. The goal of the project was to monitor Tor exit relays in order to “expose, document, and thwart malicious or misconfigured relays”; the researchers turned up 65 such relays over the course of their investigation, with the culprits engaging in attacks such as “SSH and HTTPS MitM, HTML injection, SSL stripping, and traffic sniffing”, or unintentionally interfering with traffic as a result of upstream censorship.</p>\n<p>Events such as the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack\">RELAY_EARLY traffic confirmation attack</a> and the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-consensus-health/2014-December/005381.html\">sybil attacks late last year</a> have only highlighted the importance of monitoring for malicious relays in the Tor network. The <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/bad-relays\">bad-relays mailing list</a> serves as a reporting channel for Tor community members who believe particular relays are up to no good (messages sent to the list are not publicly visible, for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-news/2014-August/000057.html\">various reasons</a>); David Fifield has been experimenting with <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-January/008095.html\">data visualizations of significant network events</a>; and Philipp Winter, a “Spoiled Onions” co-author, has been working on additional tools (such as the above-mentioned Go sybil hunter and “<a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/user/phw/zoossh.git/\">zoossh</a>”, a speedy Tor network document parser) to make these checks more efficient — to give only a few examples of recent work by the community on this issue.</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Harmony.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

One of the two Tor-related “experiments” Mozilla planned to carry out was the operation of several high-capacity middle relays, and last week Mozilla’s Network Engineering team announced that the <a href=\"https://globe.torproject.org/#/search/query=mozilla\">new nodes</a> had been running for several weeks, in a <a href=\"https://blog.mozilla.org/it/2015/01/28/deploying-tor-relays/\">blog post</a> that explores the technical decisions and challenges they faced in setting them up.</p>\n<p>The team discussed the hardware and infrastructure chosen for the relays, configuration management using Ansible (publishing their <a href=\"https://github.com/XioNoX/moz-tor-relays/\">playbook</a> at the same time), and security practices, as well as announcing their intention to continue posting about their experiences and findings during the experiment.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Mozilla for this contribution to the Tor network!</p>\n<h1>Monthly status reports for January 2015</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of January has begun. <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000748.html\">Juha Nurmi</a> released his report first, followed by reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-January/000749.html\">Philipp Winter</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000750.html\">Damian Johnson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000751.html\">Sherief Alaa</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000752.html\">Georg Koppen</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000753.html\">David Goulet</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>meejah <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-February/008227.html\">announced</a> version 0.12.0 of txtorcon, the Tor controller client in Twisted; please see the announcement for a full list of improvements.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson submitted a draft of <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-February/008223.html\">proposal 241</a>, which aims to protect users against adversaries who are able to attack their connectivity to the Tor network and force them to use malicious guard nodes.

We try to make sure we have a <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/\">good set of specification documents</a> for the protocol at all times, so that other people can write compatible software that interoperates with Tor.</p>\n<p>Once upon a time, we used to change these specification documents whenever we changed the software's behavior.  That didn't go well.  We would have changes in the spec that we had forgotten to make in the software, and tons of inline comments where we argued about whether a particular paragraph was a good idea.</p>\n<p>So back in 2007, we introduced a lightweight change-proposal process: to make a change to the Tor protocol, you write up a little design document, and send it to the tor-dev mailing list.  Once it meets editorial quality, it can go into the <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals\">proposals repository</a>.  Once it's implemented, it can be merged into the spec.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of proposals to look at, though.  The current set of open proposals has almost 100,000 words in it! (That's almost half again as long as the Tor specs themselves.)</p>\n<p>To help people navigate through this pile of design proposals, I started to write a regular \"proposal status\" email to explain what all of the open proposals are about. Last year, however, I fell out of the habit. Tonight, I've tried to fall back in: <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/proposal-status.txt\">here's the latest proposal status writeup</a>.</p>\n<p>Below the cut, my summaries of the still-open proposals that have been added in the past couple of year -- and thanks to all the busy designers who have been working to think of ways to improve Tor! <span class='read-more'><a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-design-proposals-how-we-make-changes-our-protocol\"><strong>read&nbsp;more&nbsp;&raquo;</strong></a></span></p>"

    "content": "<p>Hi, Tor community! My name is Alison, and I'm the founder of the <a href=\"https://libraryfreedomproject.org\">Library Freedom Project</a>, an initiative that aims to make real the promise of intellectual freedom in libraries. It's a partnership among librarians, technologists, attorneys, and privacy advocates to teach librarians about surveillance threats, privacy rights, and privacy-protecting technology tools. So far, we've been all over Massachusetts and parts of New England, and we have been awarded a generous grant from the <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201450256/\">Knight Foundation</a> to bring privacy training to libraries across the United States.</p>\n<p>We teach librarians three things. <a href=\"https://privacysos.org\">Kade Crockford</a> of the ACLU of Massachusetts teaches the current state of digital surveillance. Jessie Rossman, an attorney and surveillance law expert also from the ACLU of Massachusetts, offers a privacy-focused “know your rights” training. I teach technology tools – like Tor and Tails .</p>\n<p>Libraries have historically been staunch defenders of privacy, <a href=\"http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=ifissues&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=32307\">taking public stands</a> against surveillance initiatives like the USA PATRIOT Act. Libraries offer public internet terminals, and librarians like me teach free computer classes to the public. Our patrons come from all walks of life, but we tend to serve communities particularly vulnerable to surveillance (including immigrants, Muslim Americans, people of color, people who are homeless, and those who have been incarcerated) in higher numbers than in the general population. For all of these reasons, libraries are an obvious place to promote and protect online privacy and anonymity and fight against digital censorship and surveillance – that's why I started the Library Freedom Project.</p>\n<p>While we focus on US libraries, we are eager to speak to our colleagues in other countries, since privacy is a right for everyone in every country (and privacy is threatened everywhere).</p>\n<p>In the tech part of my trainings, I teach tools like the Tor Browser, Tails, HTTPS Everywhere, and DuckDuckGo. I show librarians how to install these on public PCs, and provide curricula for librarians who want to teach privacy-focused computer classes. I help library staff configure Tor relays and set their library websites to run on HTTPS by default. They are thrilled to learn about these tools – as I said, librarians as a profession have always valued privacy, but the development of mass surveillance technologies has outpaced their technical ability. They want to protect their patrons, but they don't know where to start. Thanks to the tools developed by folks in the Tor community, I've been able to teach librarians the skills they need to take anti-surveillance tools to the public. Librarians whom I've trained have started teaching their own classes to library patrons, and the public response has been overwhelmingly positive and moving – these classes make a real difference in the lives of everyday people who are desperate to learn practical ways to take back their digital privacy. The work of the Tor community makes it possible for me and other librarians to help them do this.</p>\n<p>So please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks for all that you do. Without tools developed by the Tor community, my work would not be possible. On a personal level, I'm awed by how welcoming and helpful this community has been to me. Tor community folks have offered me feedback, encouragement, and assistance at every turn. Tor Project core member Nima Fatemi even helped build my website (thanks again Nima, I owe you big time!). Now that I run the Library Freedom Project full time, I look forward to working even more closely with folks from the Tor community, and I'd love to give back to your community the way you've given to mine. One specific way that librarians can help the Tor Project is with usability issues – we have lots of experience helping ordinary users with common usability problems. I'd like to introduce developers to librarians who've installed anonymity tools and other free software in their libraries. Librarians can also run dev sprints, help update documentation, and generally advocate for tools that help safeguard privacy and anonymity.</p>\n<p>With Knight funding, our goal is to conduct 100 librarian trainings in two years, and build a website of resources for librarians who want to teach their communities how to protect themselves against online surveillance. I'll be traveling all over the US to do this, so please get in touch with me to see if I'm coming to your city! I'd love to bring Tor community members with me to my trainings and help develop a partnership between our two communities.</p>\n<p>For more information about the Library Freedom Project, to get involved in the fight for digital civil liberties in libraries, or to offer your own ideas for how this project can move forward, visit <a href=\"https://libraryfreedomproject.org\">our website</a> or <a href=\"mailto:alison@libraryfreedomproject.org\">contact me</a>.</p>"

Additionally, there has been research on \"<a href=\"https://www.petsymposium.org/2012/papers/hotpets12-1-usability.pdf\">stopping points</a>,\" common points where people would get frustrated with Tor enough that they would stop the installation process or stop using Tor. Usability issues also can degrade user experience, cause confusion, or even cause people to accidentally deanonymize themselves. </p>\n<p>To address usability issues broadly, we brought together Tor developers, designers, users, and researchers to discuss usability problems and how to fix them. Last weekend, there was a <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2015UXsprint\">user experience (UX) sprint</a> dedicated to improving the usability of Tor Browser.</p>\n<p>A major part of the sprint was user testing the current <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-browser-403-released\">Tor Browser (4.0.3)</a>. We asked users&mdash;some with prior Tor experience, some without&mdash;to perform some common tasks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Search for, download, and install Tor Browser</li>\n<li>Do a web search</li>\n<li>Watch a video</li>\n<li>Use \"New Identity\"</li>\n<li>Interact with and describe the current browser toolbar buttons</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The users performed this task in a \"cognitive walkthrough\" fashion, talking aloud while completing each of the tasks, explaining their understanding of the task and motivation for completing it in that specific way. With permission, we recorded the contents of the computer screen so developers could watch in another room. We hope to present the screen videos and other outcomes of the sprint at the upcoming <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2015WinterDevMeeting\">winter dev meeting</a>.</p>\n<p>Because of the limited size of the study (there were five participants), it's not possible to state with confidence what fraction of users will encounter major usability obstacles. However, it was effective at discovering and demonstrating issues that are likely to cause problems for many users. We will use our observations to guide future experiments. A few aspects stood out as deserving of further attention:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\nWhile searching for Tor Browser, users encountered various sources for the browser other than our target <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html\">\"Easy Download\" page</a>, and also found some odd sources for documentation. Users who found a download page other than the \"easy\" version expressed varying degrees of confusion, depending on their landing page. Ticket <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/14686\">#14685</a> is about finding a way to consolidate or drive users to our preferred download page.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatekeeper_(OS_X)\">Gatekeeper</a> on OS X makes it hard to install programs that aren't signed by an <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html\">Apple certificate</a> or don't come from the App Store. All users were at least temporarily delayed by this dialog:\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/graphs/blogfiles/gatekeeper-yosemite.png\" alt=\"TorBrowser can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.\">\n</p>\n<p>\nEven though everyone was able to get past the dialog, it was a big obstacle to installation. (If it happens to you, the trick is to Ctrl-click on the Tor Browser icon and select \"Open\".) To solve this problem is not easy, but we can perhaps make it better by providing better documentation. Ticket <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6540\">#6540</a> tracks this issue.\n</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>\nIf you try to run Tor Browser from a read-only filesystem, you get a misleading error message:\n</p>\n<p>\n<img src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~dcf/graphs/blogfiles/firefox-is-already-open.png\" alt=\"A copy of Firefox is already open. Only one copy of Firefox can be open at a time.\">\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a known issue, tracked in ticket <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/4782\">#4782</a>, that affected some users. It happens on OS X if you run the Tor Browser app directly from the disk image (.dmg) instead of first copying it to the Applications folder.\n</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tickets created as a result of the sprint have the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~uxsprint2015\">#uxsprint2015</a> tag. In addition, the new <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-usability-stoppoint&amp;status=!closed\">#tbb-usability-stoppoint</a> tag marks stopping points, to help track usability issues like the above, which result in users being unable or unwilling to continue using the browser.</p>\n<p>We hope that usability experiments and improvements will be ongoing. In the future, we'd like to test other aspects of Tor Browser, such as downloading files, updating, and managing Tor and non-Tor browsers, as well as expanding the tests to larger and diverse user groups. If you are interested in helping improve the usability of Tor Browser, <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/about/contact\">get in touch</a> by email or IRC. We need help from a lot of different kinds of people: designers, translators, programmers, and usability experts to name a few.</p>\n<p>We thank the Tor Project for supporting the sprint, the participants, those who helped us recruit on short notice, and those who helped us plan and set goals and everyone who attended as a developer or observer: Arlo, Arthur, Ashkan, David, Griffin, Isis, Krishna, Linda, Mike, and Nima. We also thank the Tor help desk, whose <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~tbb-helpdesk-frequent&amp;status=!closed\">#tbb-helpdesk-frequent</a> tag helped us prioritize tickets. Special thanks go to Nima for suggesting the idea of a UX meeting in the first place.</p>\n<p>Linda Lee and David Fifield</p>"

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the sixth issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/news-team\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the community around Tor, “<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/tor-the-last-bastion-of-online-anonymity-but-is-it-still-secure-after-silk-road-35395\">your online an-onionising software</a>”.</p>\n<h1>The 2015 Tor UX Sprint</h1>\n<p>Many open-source privacy tools struggle with questions of usability: so much effort goes into ensuring they are secure that few resources are left over to work on the user experience. But as Linda Lee and David Fifield <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ux-sprint-2015-wrapup\">write</a>, “usability is critical to security”: user interface issues “can degrade user experience, cause confusion, or even cause people to accidentally deanonymize themselves”.</p>\n<p>To explore, and hopefully solve, some of these problems, a group of Tor developers, designers, users, and researchers <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/meetings/2015UXsprint\">met</a> at UC Berkeley at the start of the month. As part of the weekend, users were asked to walk through the process of installing and running Tor Browser, noting aloud their assumptions and reactions as they went.</p>\n<p>Issues and “stopping points” (where users find the process too difficult to continue) discovered during these sessions were noted, and have been assigned tickets on Tor’s <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~uxsprint2015\">bug tracker</a>. For more details of the event and its outcomes, please see Linda and David’s post; “if you are interested in helping to improve the usability of Tor Browser, get in touch by email or IRC”.</p>\n<h1>Tor and the Library Freedom Project</h1>\n<p>As Tor Weekly News reported <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-news/2014-September/000063.html\">last September</a>, Massachusetts librarian and activist Alison Macrina has been leading a campaign to educate colleagues and library patrons on the state of digital surveillance and the use of privacy-preserving software such as Tor and Tails. As Alison and April Glaser wrote at the time, “<a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2014/09/13/radical-librarianship-how-nin.html\">libraries provide access to information and protect patrons’ right to explore new ideas, no matter how controversial or subversive</a>”.</p>\n<p>These initial workshops formed the basis for the <a href=\"https://libraryfreedomproject.org/\">Library Freedom Project</a>, which has just <a href=\"http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201450256/\">received</a> a grant from the Knight Foundation to expand its activities beyond the New England region. In a guest post on the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/guest-post-library-freedom-project-bringing-privacy-and-anonymity-libraries\">Tor blog</a>, Alison introduced the project, the motivations behind it, and its plans for the next few years, as well as suggesting some possible areas for collaboration with the Tor community in the future: “One specific way that librarians can help the Tor Project is with usability issues – we have lots of experience helping ordinary users with common usability problems […] Librarians can also run dev sprints, help update documentation, and generally advocate for tools that help safeguard privacy and anonymity.”</p>\n<p>For more information on the Library Freedom Project, or to propose your own ideas, please see the project’s website. Thanks to Alison and colleagues for this important work!</p>\n<h1>Vidalia laid to rest</h1>\n<p>Now that Vidalia, the graphical user interface for Tor, has been completely unmaintained ”for too long to be a recommended solution”, Sebastian Hahn has  <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-February/036833.html\">removed</a> the last links to Vidalia-related content from the Tor Project website. If you are still using a version of Tor Browser (outside of Tails) that contains Vidalia, it is almost certainly too old to be safe, so please upgrade as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>Vidalia is still shipped in the latest version of Tails, however, so the Tails team has been <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-February/008066.html\">working</a> on a <a href=\"http://git.tails.boum.org/alan/tor-monitor/\">simple interface</a> to replace one of the most-missed features of the defunct program, the circuit visualization window. The Tor Browser team have already implemented a similar per-site <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/8641\">circuit diagram</a> in the current 4.5-alpha series, so there should soon be no reason at all for users to continue controlling their Tor through Vidalia.</p>\n<h1>More monthly status reports for January 2015</h1>\n<p>The wave of regular monthly reports from Tor project members for the month of January continued, with reports from <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000754.html\">George Kadianakis</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000755.html\">Pearl Crescent</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000756.html\">Michael Schloh von Bennewitz</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000757.html\">Nick Mathewson</a>, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000758.html\">Karsten Loesing</a>, and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000761.html\">Arlo Breault</a>.</p>\n<p>Mike Perry reported on behalf of the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000759.html\">Tor Browser team</a>, and George Kadianakis sent out the report for <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-reports/2015-February/000760.html\">SponsorR</a>.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>George Kadianakis <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-February/008228.html\">linked</a> to the technical report produced by the team working on statistics related to the amount of hidden service usage on the Tor network; Karsten Loesing <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-February/008249.html\">added</a> some more information regarding the fraction of network activity this represents. These are advanced calculations, so if you’re not experienced in data science but want to know more about this topic, the team will be back shortly with a more “casual-reader-friendly” analysis of the results.</p>\n<p>“Fresh off a round of real-world intensive testing and debugging using spotty 2.5G coverage in the foothills of the Himalayas”, Nathan Freitas of the ever-intrepid Guardian Project <a href=\"https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2015-February/004192.html\">announced</a> the first release candidate for version 14.1 of ChatSecure, the “most private” messaging client for Android and iOS, featuring numerous improvements to usability, stability, and network handling. Please see Nathan’s announcement for the full changelog.</p>\n<p>Nathan also <a href=\"https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2015-February/004183.html\">shared</a> a “very early” incarnation of PLUTO, “a simplified means for developers to include traffic obfuscation capabilities into their applications” with initial support for obfs4 and meek. “We think many apps could utilize this approach to defeat DPI filtering, and that this would be useful to offer decoupled from the way Tor integrates it”.</p>\n<p>David Fifield posted a <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-February/008239.html\">tutorial</a> for configuring the meek pluggable transport to work with hard-to-block HTTPS websites interested in helping censored Tor users, rather than the large content delivery networks it currently uses, along with the regular <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-February/008235.html\">summary</a> of the costs incurred by meek’s infrastructure last month: “meek has so far been a smashing success. It’s the #2 pluggable transport behind obfs3 and it moved over 5 TB of traffic last month. But the costs are starting to get serious.” If you have ideas for supporting this vitally important anti-censorship tool, please see David’s message for more details.</p>\n<p>Also in meek news, Across The Great FireWall <a href=\"http://www.atgfw.org/2015/02/torgfwpk1-meektor.html\">published</a> a Chinese-language introduction to the concepts underpinning this pluggable transport. Other resources (in Chinese and other languages) are listed on the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek#Quickstart\">wiki</a>.</p>\n<p>Nick Mathewson took to the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-design-proposals-how-we-make-changes-our-protocol\">Tor blog</a> to explain exactly what Tor design proposals are for and how they are written, and offered <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/proposal-status.txt\">status updates</a> (and review recommendations) for some new and still-open proposals.</p>\n<p>Nick also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2015-February/006358.html\">asked</a> relay operators to contribute their advice to a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13703\">relay hardening guide</a> that could be shipped with Tor.</p>\n<p>Arturo Filastò <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/ooni-dev/2015-February/000246.html\">asked for help</a> in coming up with a roadmap for the future of the Open Observatory of Network Interference, asking for opinions on a range of possible development, deployment, and research projects. Feel free to let the ooni-dev list know which of the ideas catches your attention.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-January/036549.html\">soliciting feedback</a> on including newer pluggable transports in Tails, the Tails team <a href=\"https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails-dev/2015-February/008069.html\">decided</a> to focus on obfs4 and then (“tentatively”) meek for upcoming versions of the anonymous live operating system.</p>\n<p>Tom “TvdW” van der Woerdt wrote a detailed <a href=\"http://www.tvdw.eu/blog/2015/01/24/implementing-a-tor-relay-from-scratch/\">report</a> on his experience implementing a Tor client from scratch in the Go programming language, following Tor’s specification document. One instance of “GoTor” briefly broke the Tor relay speed record with 250 megabytes/second, but Tom ultimately decided that Go isn’t the right language for such a thing, as its library support doesn’t make it easy enough to do. Thanks to Tom for running the experiment, and catching some specification errors in the process!</p>\n<p>Even though Tor Browser is not vulnerable to the recent WebRTC IP attack proof-of-concept <a href=\"https://github.com/diafygi/webrtc-ips\">proof-of-concept</a>, Mike Perry nevertheless <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-February/036845.html\">invited</a> “interested parties to try harder to bypass Tor in a stock Firefox using WebRTC and associated protocols (RTSP, SCTP) with media.peerconnection.enabled set to false”, before a plan to enable WebRTC-based <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/14837\">QRCode bridge address resolution and sharing in Tor Launcher</a> is implemented.</p>\n<p>Shadow, the tool by Rob Jansen that allows full Tor network simulation, now has a new <a href=\"https://shadow.github.io\">website</a>. As Rob <a href=\"http://mailman.cs.umn.edu/archives/shadow-dev/2015-February/000081.html\">wrote</a>: “The new website still uses the Jekyll engine, and is a stripped down customized version of the open source SOLID theme. Please send me feedback if you have it.”</p>\n<p>Jillian York of the EFF <a href=\"http://jilliancyork.com/2015/02/06/there-are-other-funding-options-than-the-usg/\">discussed</a> the problems of over-reliance on US government funding — and the dearth of other funding streams — for anti-surveillance tools, including Tor.</p>\n<p>Seven of the eleven activists arrested last year in Spain for, amongst other things, having had email accounts with the technical collective Riseup — longtime Tor allies and <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-news/2014-November/000073.html\">operators of one of the directory authorities</a> — have been <a href=\"https://www.accessnow.org/blog/2015/01/20/spain-targets-vulnerable-users-on-eve-of-review-at-un-human-rights-council\">released from prison</a>. As Riseup <a href=\"https://help.riseup.net/en/about-us/press/security-not-a-crime\">wrote</a> following the arrests, “security is not a crime”: “Giving up your basic right to privacy for fear of being flagged as a terrorist is unacceptable.”</p>\n<h1>Easy development tasks to get involved with</h1>\n<p>Two problems confronting Mac users who want to download Tor Browser are the “disk image” format and Apple’s Gatekeeper security system. If these users try to run Tor Browser directly from the disk image window that opens after downloading, they will receive an error telling them “Firefox is already running”, and if they correctly move the program to the Applications folder, Gatekeeper will prevent them from running it directly anyway.</p>\n<p>If you have access to a machine running the latest version of Mac OS X, and want to spend ten minutes making life easier for Tor users, the Tor Browser <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy\">download page</a> would benefit from screenshots showing users how to drag the program to the Applications folder, and how to disable Gatekeeper by control-clicking on the Tor Browser icon when running for the first time. Please see the relevant <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/14838\">bug ticket</a> for a nice set of example screenshots; your contribution will be gratefully received!</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Harmony, Roger Dingledine, Kate Krauss, and David Fifield.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the seventh issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Onion services</h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services\">Anonymous web services hosted in the Tor network</a> have until now been referred to as “hidden services”. Although this name accurately describes one of their properties, it does not convey some of the other benefits that the system provides, like end-to-end encryption without a purchased SSL certificate, or self-authenticating domain names outside of the commercial DNS system. Furthermore, as Aaron Johnson <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-February/008256.html\">points out</a>, words like “hidden” and “dark” have an unnecessarily negative connotation.</p>\n<p>Aaron and other members of the SponsorR team declared themselves in favor of using the word “onion” (as in “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing\">onion routing</a>”) to characterize Tor-protected web services. “Hidden services” could be renamed “onion services”, while websites offered as onion services are “onionsites”; an onion service’s URL is its “onion address”, while the dreaded “Dark Web” becomes simply “onionspace”.</p>\n<p>A full list of new and more precise terminology is in Aaron’s message and on the <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors/SponsorR/Terminology\">Tor wiki</a>; please feel free to contribute to the discussion on the tor-dev mailing list with your thoughts.</p>\n<h1>Miscellaneous news</h1>\n<p>Nathan Freitas of the Guardian Project <a href=\"https://lists.mayfirst.org/pipermail/guardian-dev/2015-February/004243.html\">announced</a> the release of version 15-alpha-3 of Orbot. This release includes more work on VPN support, and builds on last week’s early release of the <a href=\"https://github.com/guardianproject/pluto\">PLUTO library</a> to offer support for <a href=\"https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/meek\">meek</a>, although it is not currently possible to use both at the same time. See Nathan’s announcement for usage instructions and download links.</p>\n<p>Yawning Angel <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-February/008279.html\">asked for comments</a> on an implementation of a <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/6411\">proposal</a> to let Tor create “ephemeral” onion services, using key material that is supplied at runtime rather than stored on the disk. See Yawning’s post for a detailed explanation of the concept and a link to the new code; however, trying to run this untested and unreviewed new branch “WILL BROADCAST YOUR SECRETS TO THE NSA’S ORBITAL SPACE STATION”, so don’t do that.</p>\n<p>Yawning also <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-February/008306.html\">announced</a> version 0.0.4 of obfs4proxy, which “is more useful for the Tor Browser people than anyone else, since it means that the next build can remove the old go.crypto cruft from the build process, and the ScrambleSuit client provider can be switched over to obfs4proxy like obfs2 and obfs3 have been”.</p>\n<p>SiNA Rabbani announced that Faravahar, the directory authority which he operates, will be <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-February/008278.html\">moving to a new IP address on Friday</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-mirrors/2015-February/000858.html\">cuanto</a> for running a mirror of the Tor Project website and software!</p>\n<p>Thomas White <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-February/036886.html\">published</a> a <a href=\"https://www.thecthulhu.com/setting-up-a-hidden-service-with-nginx/\">guide</a> to configuring an Nginx webserver as a hidden service: “It isn’t intended to be a hardening guide or an ultra secure way of hosting, but it is for people who want to casually publish some static HTML files or with a little extra configuration to host some applications”.</p>\n<p>Collin Anderson and the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab made a <a href=\"https://citizenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/SR-FOE-submission.pdf\">joint submission</a> to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, examining the importance of digital security software such as Tor in upholding free expression and the right to privacy.</p>\n<p>carlo von lynX <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-February/036911.html\">wondered</a> about the truth of the statement that “it would take latencies in the order of hours to fully make communications impossible to shape and correlate”. Roger Dingledine clarified <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-talk/2015-February/036912.html\"></a>: “It’s actually worse than that — we have no idea. I’d love to have a graph where the x axis is how much additional overhead (latency, bandwidth, whatever) we’re willing to add, and the y axis is how much additional security (anonymity, privacy, whatever) we can get. Currently we have zero data points for this graph.”</p>\n<hr/>\nThis issue of Tor Weekly News has been assembled by Harmony and Roger Dingledine.</p>\n<p>Want to continue reading TWN?

    "content": "<p>Welcome to the eighth issue in 2015 of Tor Weekly News, the <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-news\">weekly newsletter</a> that covers what’s happening in the Tor community.</p>\n<h1>Tor 0.2.6-alpha-3 is out</h1>\n<p>Nick Mathewson <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0263-alpha-released\">announced</a> the third (“and hopefully final”) alpha release in the Tor 0.2.6.x series. The major user- and operator-facing changes in this release include support for AF_UNIX sockets, allowing high-risk applications to reach a local Tor without having to enable other kinds of networking activity; a new warning for relay operators, in order to make it even harder to accidentally run an exit node; improvements and additions to the directory system; and much else besides.</p>\n<p>See Nick’s announcement for the full changelog, and download your copy of the source code from the <a href=\"https://dist.torproject.org/\">distribution directory</a>, but note that “this is an alpha release”, so “please expect bugs”.</p>\n<h1>Tails 1.3 is out</h1>\n<p>The Tails team <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/news/version_1.3/\">announced</a> version 1.3 of the anonymous live operating system. This release brings several major new features, including Bitcoin support with Electrum; connections to Tor using the obfs4 pluggable transport; an AppArmor profile to protect the filesystem against some kinds of attack on Tor Browser; a simpler Tails drive creation process on Mac and Linux; and more intuitive handling of computer trackpads.</p>\n<p>See the announcement for links to the full list of changes and known issues, and download your copy from the <a href=\"https://tails.boum.org/download/\">website</a> or, if you already have a running Tails, using the incremental update system.</p>\n<h1>CITIZENFOUR wins many awards</h1>\n<p>Laura Poitras’ documentary film <a href=\"https://citizenfourfilm.com/\">CITIZENFOUR</a>, recording the initial encounters between herself, journalist Glenn Greenwald, and the American surveillance whistleblower (and sometime <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/05/snowden-cryptoparty/\">Tor relay operator</a>) Edward Snowden, has been decorated at numerous awards ceremonies over the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenfour#Awards_and_nominations\">past few months</a> for its artistic and political achievement.</p>\n<p>The filmmakers have been tireless in their activism on behalf of Tor and the free software community both in the mainstream press and at <a href=\"https://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6258_-_en_-_saal_1_-_201412282030_-_reconstructing_narratives_-_jacob_-_laura_poitras.html\">community conferences</a>; upon <a href=\"http://www.nationinstitute.org/blog/prizes/4376/%22citizenfour%22_will_receive_the_ridenhour_documentary_film_prize/\">receiving the Ridenhour Documentary Film Prize</a> last week, Laura called attention to the role of these projects in the production process: “This film and our NSA reporting would not have been possible without the work of the Free Software community that builds free tools to communicate privately. The prize money for the award will be given to the Tails Free Software project.”</p>\n<p>CITIZENFOUR went on to win the <a href=\"http://www.filmindependent.org/press/press-releases/2015-film-independent-spirit-awards-winners-announced/\">Independent Spirit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2015\">Academy</a> Awards for Best Documentary Feature over the weekend.

    "content": "<p>The Tor Browser team is proud to announce the release of the fourth alpha of the 4.5 series of Tor Browser. The release is available from the <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads-alpha\">extended downloads page</a> and also from our <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/dist/torbrowser/4.5a4/\">distribution directory</a>.</p>\n<p>Tor Browser 4.5a4 is based on Firefox ESR 31.5.0, which features <a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefoxESR.html#firefoxesr31.5\">important security updates</a> to Firefox. Moreover, this release includes an updated Tor, 0.2.6.3-alpha, and switches Scramblesuit and obfs3 bridge support to a new golang-based implementation. We are especially interested in hearing any issues with using obfs3, obfs4, and Scramblesuit in this release.</p>\n<p>The release also features several improvements to usability, following the results of the <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/ux-sprint-2015-wrapup\">usability sprint</a> at the end of last month. In particular, the Torbutton onion menu and related preference windows have been overhauled to provide more simplicity and more focus. The onion menu now features a much requested \"New Circuit for this site\" option, and the security and privacy settings window have been simplified. For censored users, the first run configuration wizard was also improved to present the choice of Pluggable Transport before the local proxy information, in an effort to avoid confusion between Pluggable Transports and local proxies. As can be seen from the changelog below, the release contains several other usability tweaks and enhancements as well.</p>\n<p>Here is the full changelog for changes since 4.5-alpha-3:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All Platforms\n<ul>\n<li>Update Firefox to 31.5.0esr\n<li>Update Tor to 0.2.6.3-alpha\n<li>Update OpenSSL to 1.0.1l\n<li>Update NoScript to 2.6.9.15\n<li>Update obfs4proxy to 0.0.4\n<ul>\n<li>Use obfs4proxy for ScrambleSuit bridges\n   </ul>\n<li>Update Torbutton to 1.9.0.0\n<ul>\n<li>Bug 13882: Fix display of bridges after bridge settings have been changed\n<li>Bug 5698: Use \"Tor Browser\" branding in \"About Tor Browser\" dialog\n<li>Bug 10280: Strings and pref for preventing plugin initialization.\n<li>Bug 14866: Show correct circuit when more than one exists for a given domain\n<li>Bug 9442: Add New Circuit button to Torbutton menu\n<li>Bug 9906: Warn users before closing all windows and performing new identity.\n<li>Bug 8400: Prompt for restart if disk records are enabled/disabled.\n<li>Bug 14630: Hide Torbutton's proxy settings tab.\n<li>Bug 14632: Disable Cookie Manager until we get it working.\n<li>Bug 11175: Remove \"About Torbutton\" from onion menu.\n<li>Bug 13900: Remove remaining SafeCache code in favor of C++ patch\n<li>Bug 14490: Use Disconnect search in about:tor search box\n<li>Bug 14392: Don't steal input focus in about:tor search box\n<li>Bug 11236: Don't set omnibox order in Torbutton (to prevent translation)\n<li>Bug 13406: Stop directing users to download-easy.html.en on update\n<li>Bug 9387: Handle \"custom\" mode better in Security Slider\n<li>Bug 12430: Bind jar: pref to Security Slider\n<li>Bug 14448: Restore Torbutton menu operation on non-English localizations\n<li>Translation updates\n   </ul>\n<li>Update Tor Launcher to 0.2.7.2\n<ul>\n<li>Bug 13271: Display Bridge Configuration wizard pane before Proxy pane\n<li>Bug 14336: Fix navigation button display issues on some wizard panes\n<li>Translation updates\n   </ul>\n<li>Bug 14203: Prevent meek from displaying an extra update notification\n<li>Bug 14849: Remove new NoScript menu option to make permissions permanent\n<li>Bug 14851: Set NoScript pref to disable permanent permissions\n<li>Bug 14490: Make Disconnect the default omnibox search engine\n<li>Bug 11236: Fix omnibox order for non-English builds\n<ul>\n<li>Also remove Amazon, eBay and bing; add Youtube and Twitter\n   </ul>\n<li>Bug 10280: Don't load any plugins into the address space.\n<li>Bug 14392: Make about:tor hide itself from the URL bar\n<li>Bug 12430: Provide a preference to disable remote jar: urls\n<li>Bug 13900: Remove 3rd party HTTP auth tokens via Firefox patch\n<li>Bug 5698: Fix branding in \"About Torbrowser\" window\n </ul>\n<li>Windows:\n<ul>\n<li>Bug 13169: Don't use /dev/random on Windows for SSP\n </ul>\n<li>Linux:\n<ul>\n<li>Bug 13717: Make sure we use the bash shell on Linux\n </ul>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once again, the individual bundles of both Tor Browser series are signed by one of the subkeys of the Tor Browser Developers signing key from now on.

    "content": "<p><b>Non-technical abstract:</b></p>\n<p><i><br />\nWe are starting a project to study and quantify hidden services traffic. As part of this project, we are collecting data from just a few volunteer relays which only allow us to see a small portion of hidden service activity (between 2% and 5%). Extrapolating from such a small sample is difficult, and our data are preliminary. </p>\n<p>We've been working on methods to improve our calculations, but with our current methodology, we estimate that about 30,000 hidden services announce themselves to the Tor network every day, using about 5 terabytes of data daily. We also found that hidden service traffic is about 3.4% of total Tor traffic, which means that, at least according to our early calculations, 96.6% of Tor traffic is *not* hidden services. We invite people to join us in working to research methodologies and develop systems for better understanding Tor hidden services.<br />\n</i></p>\n<hr>\n<br></p>\n<p>Hello,</p>\n<p>Over the past months we've been working on hidden service statistics. Our goal has been to answer the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>\"Approximately how many hidden services are there?\"</b></li>\n<li><b>\"Approximately how much traffic of the Tor network is going to hidden services?\"</b></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>We chose the above two questions because even though we want to understand hidden services, we really don't want to harm the privacy of Tor users. From a privacy perspective, the above two questions are relatively easy questions to answer because we don't need data from clients or the hidden services themselves; we just need data from hidden service directories and rendezvous points. Furthermore, the measurements reported by each relay cannot be linked back to specific hidden services or their clients.</p>\n<p>Our first move was to <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-November/007816.html\">research various ways we could collect these statistics in a privacy-preserving manner</a>. After <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2014-December/007911.html\">days of discussions on obfuscating statistics</a>, we began writing <a href=\"https://gitweb.torproject.org//torspec.git/tree/proposals/238-hs-relay-stats.txt\">a Tor proposal</a> with our design, as well as <a href=\"https://bugs.torproject.org/13192\">code that implements the proposal</a>. The code has since been reviewed and <a href=\"https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-0262-alpha-released\">merged to Tor</a>! The statistics are currently disabled by default so <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-relays/2014-December/005953.html\">we asked volunteer relay operators to explicitly turn them on</a>. Currently there are about 70 relays publishing measurements to us every 24 hours:<br />\n<br><br />\n<img alt=\"Number of relays reporting stats\" src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~asn/hsstsblgpst/num-reported-stats.png\"  width=\"100%\"></img><br />\n<br><br />\nSo as of now we've been receiving these measurements for over a month, and we have thought a lot about how to best use the reported measurements to derive interesting results. We finally have some <i>preliminary results</i> we would like to share with you:</p>\n<h2>How many hidden services are there?</h2>\n<p>All in all, it seems that </i>every day about 30000 hidden services announce themselves to the hidden service directories</i>. Graphically:<br />\n<br><br />\n<img alt=\"Number of hidden services\" src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~asn/hsstsblgpst/extrapolated-onions.png\" width=\"100%\"></img><br />\n<br><br />\nBy <i>counting the number of unique hidden service addresses seen by HSDirs</i>, we can get the approximate number of hidden services. Keep in mind that we can only see between 2% and 5% of the total HSDir space, so the extrapolation is, naturally, messy.</p>\n<h2>How much traffic do hidden services cause?</h2>\n<p>Our preliminary results show that hidden services cause somewhere <i>between 400 to 600 Mbit of traffic per second</i>, or equivalently about <i>4.9 terabytes a day</i>. Here is a graph:<br />\n <br><br />\n<img alt=\"Hidden services traffic volume\" src=\"https://people.torproject.org/~asn/hsstsblgpst/extrapolated-cells.png\" width=\"100%\"></img><br />\n<br><br />\nWe learned this by getting rendezvous points to publish the total number of cells transferred over rendezvous circuits, which allows us to learn the approximate volume of hidden service traffic. Notice that our coverage here is not very good either, with a probability of about 5% that a hidden service circuit will use a relay that reports these statistics as a rendezvous point.</p>\n<p>A related statistic here is <i>\"How much of the Tor network is actually hidden service usage?\"</i>. There are <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-February/008249.html\">two different ways</a> to answer this question, depending on whether we want to understand what clients are doing or what the network is doing. The fraction of hidden-service traffic at Tor clients differs from the fraction at Tor relays because connections to hidden services use 6-hop circuits while connections to the regular Internet use 3-hop circuits. As a result, the fraction of hidden-service traffic entering or leaving Tor is about half of the fraction of hidden-service traffic inside of Tor. Our conclusion is that about <i>3.4% of client traffic is hidden-service traffic, and 6.1% of traffic seen at a relay is hidden-service traffic</i>.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion and future work</h1>\n<p>In this blog post we presented some preliminary results that could be extracted from these new hidden service statistics. We hope that this data can help us better gauge the future development and maturity of the <i>onion space</i> as well as detect potential incidents and bugs on the network. To better present our results and methods, <a href=\"https://research.torproject.org/techreports/extrapolating-hidserv-stats-2015-01-31.pdf\">we wrote a short technical report</a> that outlines the exact process we followed. We invite you to read it if you are curious about the methodology or the results.</p>\n<p>Finally, this project is only a few months old, and there are various plans for the future. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\nThere are more interesting questions that we could examine in this area. For example: \"How many people are using hidden services every day?\" and \"How many times does someone try to visit a hidden service that does not exist anymore?.\"</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, some of these questions are not easy to answer with the current statistics reporting infrastructure, mainly because collecting them in this way could reveal information about specific hidden services but also because the results of the current system contain too much obfuscating data (each reporting relay randomizes its numbers a little bit before publishing them, so we can learn about totals but not about specific events).</p>\n<p>For this reason, <a href=\"https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-dev/2015-January/008086.html\">we've been analyzing various statistics aggregation protocols</a> that could be used in place of the current system, allowing us to safely collect other kinds of statistics.</li>\n<p><br></p>\n<li>\nWe need to incorporate these statistics in <a href=\"https://metrics.torproject.org/\">our Metrics portal</a> so that they are updated regularly and so that everyone can follow them.</li>\n<p><br></p>\n<li>\nCurrently, these hidden service statistics are not collected in relays by default. Unfortunately, that gives us very small coverage of the network, which in turn makes our extrapolations very <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_%28signal_processing%29\">noisy</a>. The main reason that these statistics are disabled by default is that similar statistics are also disabled (e.g. CellStatistics). Also, this allows us more time to consider privacy consequences. As we analyze more of these statistics and think more about statistics privacy, we should decide whether to turn these statistics on by default.</p>\n<p>It's worth repeating that the current results are preliminary and should be digested with a grain of salt. We invite statistically-inclined people to review our code, methods, and results. If you are a researcher interested in digging into the measurements themselves, you can find them in the <a href=\"https://collector.torproject.org/archive/relay-descriptors/extra-infos/\">extra-info descriptors of Tor relays</a>.</p>\n<p>Over the next months, we will also be thinking more about these problems to figure out proper ways to analyze and safely measure private ecosystems like the onion space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Till then, take care, and enjoy Tor!</p>"
